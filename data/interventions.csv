NCT03715543,Procedure,Surgical Resection of the Greater Splanchnic Nerve,"Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) is performed under general anesthesia using existing, CE marked instrumentation. Two or more 5 mm incisions are used to pass a tiny video camera and a single dissecting instrument into the chest. These small ports are advantageous because the chance for infection and wound dehiscence are drastically reduced. This allows for a faster recovery by the patient and a greater chance for the wound to heal.

In the procedure the GSN will be identified visually or through stimulation-induced hemodynamic reflex. The GSN will then be ablated using standard techniques. If there are multiple branches of the GSN, each branch will be systematically identified and ablated.",Surgical Resection Arm,

Once the anatomy deemed acceptable, the radiofrequency ablation catheter will be introduced into ostium of the left PA and the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.

The catheter will be manoeuvred within the PA to allow energy delivery in a circumferential manner to ensure that the electrodes are tightly in contact with the endovascular surface. About three ablations at 45-55 °C for 120 seconds each will be performed in ostium of the left PA and the distal bifurcation area of the main PA.

For non-atrial fibrillation patients, dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 month after PADN is recommended.

Participants will sit comfortably in an upright chair with a straight back; armrests are optional. Their feet must remain flat on the floor with legs uncrossed to ensure unobstructed blood flow and a stable posture. Arms should be relaxed and placed in their lap, on a flat surface (e.g., table), or on the armrest, ensuring they are not tensed or elevated. Participants will maintain a straight back with relaxed shoulders throughout the session.

To begin, participants will press the Event Button on the Peerbridge CORTM mobile device, marking the start of the session. They will remain seated in this position for 15 minutes. At the end of the session, participants will press the Event Button again to mark the conclusion of the seated event.

Longitudinal strain and strain rate curves are generated for each of six atrial segments, obtained from the apical four and two chamber views.

In the reservoir phase, as the LA fills and stretches, there is positive atrial strain that reaches its peak in systole at the end of LA filling, prior to opening of the mitral valve. Following this, passive LA emptying ensues with opening of the mitral valve resulting in decreased atrial strain with negative deflection of the strain curve up to a plateau period which is analogous to diastasis. LA reservoir strain (LARS), or peak atrial longitudinal strain or LA systolic strain, is measured at the end of the reservoir phase.","HIgh HFA-PEFF points (≥5), Low to intermediate HFA-PEFF points (<5)",
