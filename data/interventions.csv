The inner lumen can be gradually filled with saline over an extended period of time via the fill tube by injecting saline through the injection dome. Once expanded to the desired volume, the fill tube and injection dome are removed through a small incision under local anesthetic, and the prosthesis remains in position as a breast implant.

The Becker 50 Expander/Breast Implant has a 50% gel volume and a 50% saline volume, so a 400cc implant would nominally have 200cc of saline and 200cc of silicone. The Becker 50 Expander/Breast Implant is available in sizes from 300 to 700cc.",Reconstruction,

Additionally, results from the satisfaction survey indicated a high level of satisfaction among the families regarding the urotherapy education (Mean satisfaction score: 33.875/35.000, Minimum=28, Maximum=35). Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to deliver the same urotherapy presentation to the DMD families within the scope of this study.
