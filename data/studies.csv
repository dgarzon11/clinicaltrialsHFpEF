NCT03715543,Surgical Resection of the Greater Splanchnic Nerve in Subjects Having Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Completed,"We believe that blocking of the Greater Splanchnic Nerve (GSN) will stop Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity from reaching the splanchnic vessels and result in a redistribution of blood volume back into the splanchnic reservoir, which will result in reduction of central venous, pulmonary and right and left heart pressures. For patients having Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) we expect these changes to improve dyspnea and capacity to exercise, improve quality of life, increased diuretic responsiveness, Furthermore, the expected benefits of unloading the central venous and arterial system through GSN ablation should improve hemodynamic control and lessen the incidence and severity of acute decompensations leading to reduced re-hospitalizations and associated healthcare costs.

While routine blood tests can check magnesium levels, they don't tell us how much magnesium is actually inside the heart and muscle cells, where it's vital for energy and overall function. Our research aims to get a clearer picture by looking directly at the magnesium inside these cells and understanding its role in the body's energy production and usage. We're also interested in how magnesium levels affect symptoms and the body's handling of sugar. We're using advanced medical imaging techniques, like heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other heart and muscle function tests, at rest and when the heart is working hard to help answer these questions.

Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (or ATTR) is a subtype of amyloidosis which frequently involves heart. Cardiac ATTR, though infrequently diagnosed during lifetime, may represent a prevalent cause of RCM, especially in elderly. Several medications that can limit progression of the disease are currently under investigation. Presently the golden standard for diagnosis of ATTR is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) which may entail severe adverse complications causing under-diagnosis of ATTR.

Several papers support the evidence that Tc99m-labeled tracers can be used to detect myocardial deposits of TTR amyloid.

NCT01185067,Physiological Effects of Grape Seed Extract in Diastolic Heart Failure,GRAPEVINE-HF,Completed,"Diastolic heart failure (also known as ""heart failure with normal ejection fraction"" or ""heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"") occurs even though the heart muscle's pumping function is normal. In many cases diastolic heart failure is related to stiffening of the heart and blood vessels in people who have high blood pressure. Current guidelines suggest that patients should limit the salt content of their diet, as too much salty food can cause fluid retention and other problems in diastolic heart failure. Studies in animals with diastolic heart failure suggest that antioxidant chemicals found in grapes can block some of the harmful effects of salty diets. Because it is often difficult for patients with diastolic heart failure to maintain a low salt diet, the investigators are researching the effects of the antioxidant properties of grape seed extract, a natural supplement made from grape seeds. The investigators hypothesize that supplementing the diet with grape seed extract (GSE) can decrease the levels of harmful chemicals and improve heart and blood vessel function in patients with diastolic heart failure and a history of high blood pressure.

The University of Michigan research group plans to enroll 25 patients with a history of high blood pressure and diastolic heart failure in a research study. The study will assess the effects of GSE on hormones and other chemicals that can cause heart and blood vessel damage. The investigators will also study the effects of GSE on the ability of the blood vessels and heart muscles to relax at the proper time and speed. Finally, the investigators will observe how GSE affects participants' overall ability to exercise, quality of life, and blood pressure control. Study participants will be randomly assigned to take either GSE or placebo (looks like but does not contain GSE) capsules twice a day for six weeks. After a two-week break, all subjects will cross over to the opposite group of capsules for an additional six-week period.

NCT05731466,Exercise Right Ventricular Coupling in HFpEF,ENDURE,Recruiting,"The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility and prognostic value of right ventricular-arterial coupling (RVAC) during exercise in patients with HFpEF-PH using a hybrid technique of real-time CMRderived volume measures and CardioMEMS-derived pulmonary artery pressure measurements.

The investigators will determine:

1. Whether exercise RV-arterial coupling at baseline (assessed using hybrid CMRCardioMEMS) predicts development or worsening of exercise RV-arterial uncoupling during follow-up in HFpEF-PH patients.
2. If HFpEF-PH patients developing RV dysfunction have a particular PAP pattern as assessed remotely using the CardioMEMS system.

NCT05726474,Comparison of the Effect of Two Types of Physical Exercises in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,ExIC-FEp,Completed,"Background: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with a very important and increasingly severe social and health impact with a prevalence of 6.8% in Spain. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately 50% of all patients with HF. In the absence of pharmacological treatments that have succeeded in reducing mortality or morbidity in this pathology, it is recommended that interventions be directed at prevention, symptomatic treatment of HF and treatment of comorbidities to avoid exacerbations, thus physical exercise is recognized as an important adjunct in the treatment of HF and is recommended by the guidelines of the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Currently, aerobic exercise is the most studied physical exercise in this population, but in recent years high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and the combination of aerobic exercise with strength training (combined exercise) have emerged.

Objectives: The overall objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of combined training and HIIT on exercise capacity, diastolic function, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in patients with HFpEF. The specific objectives of this study are: a) to compare the effectiveness of combined training and HIIT on quality of life in patients with HFpEF and b) to analyze the cost-effectiveness of combined training and HIIT versus conventional treatment in patients with HFpEF.

Methodology: The ExIC-FEp study will be a single-blind randomized clinical trial with 3 arms (combined exercise, HIIT and a control group), conducted at the Health and Social Research Center of the University of Castilla-La Mancha, to analyze two types of supervised physical exercise in patients with HFpEF for 6 months. Patients with HFpEF will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the combined exercise, HIIT or control group. All participants will be examined, at baseline (prior to randomization), at three months (mid-intervention) and at six months (at the end of the intervention). Participants will undergo physical examination, echocardiography, maximal cardiopulmonary stress test, and measurement of endothelial function and arterial stiffness. In addition, sociodemographic variables, quality of life, physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, strength, spirometry and blood sampling will be measured.

Expected scientific contributions: this randomized clinical trial will represent a a significant advance in the scientific evidence available on the efficacy of physical exercise in the treatment of HFpEF, through: (a) transfer of the results to physicians, nurses and patients; (b) dissemination of results through scientific articles, doctoral theses and participation in congresses; (c) press releases and press conferences with the aim of disseminating the research results to the population; (d) dissemination through social networks to improve the social impact; and (e) design and content development of a web page.",False,"Heart Failure, Physical Exercise, Exercise Capacity, Diastolic Function, Endothelial Function, Arterial Stiffness","Behavioral, Behavioral","Combined exercise, High interval training","Exercise capacity, E velocity, Endothelial function, Arterial stiffness, A velocity, E/A ratio, e' velocity, E/e' ratio, ejection fraction, left ventricular volume index, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular mass, left atrial diameter, isovolume relaxation time, deceleration time, left atrial volume index","Sociodemographic variables, Patient's medical history, Weight, Muscular strength, Spirometry, Glucose, Physical activity, HQoL, Adherence to the Mediterranean diet, height, BMI, waist circumference, body fat, blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoproteins A1 and B, insulin, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), HbA1c",University of Castilla-La Mancha,,All,40 Years,,480.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,72,Other,Interventional,Treatment,SBPLY/21/180501/000112,,2023-01-23,2024-09-30,2025-05-15,2023-02-14,,2025-06-04,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

NCT05826821,Biomarkers in HF: Circulating Biomarkers of Fibrosis and Cardiovascular Disease,,Completed,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents one of the largest unmet needs in cardiovascular medicine. Heart muscle scarring (myocardial fibrosis) is a key HFpEF disease mechanism and represents an important therapeutic target.

Myocardial fibrosis can be measured non-invasively using the cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) extracellular volume (ECV) technique.

NCT02582021,WISE CVD - Continuation (WISE HFpEF),,Recruiting,"The Women's Ischemia Study Evaluation (WISE), a cohort study of over 1000 women, has made many contributions to the understanding of cardiovascular disease. A milestone acknowledged in the 2011 AHA Herrick Lecture is the role of Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction (CMD) in women with symptoms/signs of ischemia without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). While in 1996, CMD was considered ""an imaging artifact"", in 2013, it is a widely accepted as a pathophysiologic process requiring systematic cohesive scientific pursuit. CMD is prevalent, associated with adverse clinical outcomes, poor quality of life and healthcare costs rivaling obstructive CAD. There are 2-3 million US women with CMD, and 100,000 new cases projected annually placing CMD prevalence, morbidity and costs higher than all female reproductive cancers combined.

Among women with ischemia, preserved ejection fraction and no obstructive CAD, it has been observed that there are relatively more new onset heart failure (HF) hospitalizations than nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). It has been hypothesized that CMD contributes to left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and subsequent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Preliminary data further suggests that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is linked to CMD via a mechanism of augmentation and/or perpetuation by cardiomyocyte fat accumulation. HFpEF is prevalent in women and older men, but poorly understood. Mechanistic understanding is critical to HFpEF intervention and guideline development.

The study hypotheses are as follows:

1. Risk factor conditions (hypertension, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, loss of estrogen) promote an inflammatory and pro-oxidative state making the microvasculature vulnerable;
2. Vulnerable coronary microvasculature becomes dysregulated (sympathetic nervous system activation, endothelial dysfunction, changes in vascular smooth muscle activation, spasm) causing repeated episodes of transient ischemia;
3. Repeated ischemia-reperfusion episodes facilitate preconditioning with preservation of cardiomyocyte contractile and microvascular function against ischemic injury;
4. Ischemia-reperfusion and preconditioning lead to cardiomyocyte fat accumulation and relaxation impairment resulting in diastolic dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).",False,"Microvascular Coronary Dysfunction, Cardiovascular Disease","Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure, Procedure","Coronary Angiography, Coronary Reactivity Testing, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Computed Coronary Tomographic Angiography, Rest-Stress Millar Testing, Aortic vasorelaxation tests",Cardiovascular (CV) events,"Persistent Chest Pain Symptoms: SAQ, Persistent Chest Pain Symptoms: WISE female angina Questionnaire, Quality of Life Outcomes: SAQ, Quality of Life Outcomes: DASI",Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,,All,18 Years,,216.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",,220,Other,Observational,,Pro00037321,,2015-11-01,2025-02-01,2025-02-01,2015-10-21,,2024-09-19,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

NCT05204238,Follow Up of acuTe Heart failUre: a pRospective Echocardiographic and Clinical Study (FUTURE),FUTURE-HIT,Unknown,"Acute heart failure (AHF) is defined as rapid onset or rapid worsening of typical signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF) according to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines. AHF is the first cause of hospitalization in people over 65 in Western countries, accounting for more than 1 million hospitalizations per year in the USA. This disease has many repercussions not only in terms of mortality and morbidity, but also in terms of resources and infrastructures necessary for these patients' treatment, which constitutes a high economic burden for the national health care system. Even with growing knowledge and means, nowadays, the prognosis of AHF is still poor and there are no proven therapies that lead to long-term benefits in terms of reduced mortality. A better management of the acute phase of decompensation, including the definition of effective diagnostic-therapeutic workup and the use of innovative drugs, could improve the course of the disease, with positive effects on the patient (gain in survival and reduction of admissions), but also on the community (containment of the overall health costs). In recent years, numerous scores have been outlined in various AHF settings, considering only a small number of parameters. Several prognostic models have been developed suggesting how difficult it is to evaluate the AHF patients' prognosis. All this effort towards the development of so numerous prognostic models is justified by the fact that, despite the evolution of treatments, the risk of re-hospitalization and of both intrahospital mortality and after discharge remains high. Several studies have investigated potential prognostic factors that could help evaluating the risk of cardiovascular events, but now there is no accurate and complete prognostic score, particularly for AHF patients. Therefore, to date there are no accurate scores or determinants of short- and medium-term prognosis that allow to improve the management of these patients.

NCT06057623,Neuromuscular Fatigue and Exercise Capacity in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and HFpEF,,Active Not Recruiting,"An important feature of patients with HFpEF is impaired exercise tolerance, resulting in worsening and reduced quality of life. Studies in the literature on patients with HFpEF suggest that the limited transport of oxygen to the muscles can be one factor leading to the early development of fatigue during physical activity and reduced effort tolerance. A recent study also shows that patients with HFpEF have an increased susceptibility to both central and peripheral fatigue, suggesting that neuromuscular fatigue may be one of the main mechanisms limiting exercise in this population.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which affects 90-95% of diabetic patients, is a comorbidity of particular interest in heart failure (HF). In T2DM, as in HF, some observed an altered energy metabolism of the muscle and a shift in the type of muscle fibers. Hyperglycemia influences neuromuscular function and appeared to be one of the major causes of oxidative stress by affecting the intrinsic properties of the muscle (mitochondrial activity and function, myofilaments) related to the expression of force. The impact of diabetes on neuromuscular function is also linked to long-term complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy involving impairment of motor nerve conduction and vascular complications. This opens up a rather complex picture suggesting that T2DM in patients with HF could contribute to a further decline in muscle strength by further reducing the aerobic capacity of these patients.

It seems, there are currently no studies in the literature evaluating how much the coexistence of T2DM impacts neuromuscular fatigue and strength in patients with HF. Thus, the primary aim of this study will be to evaluate the differences in central and peripheral neuromuscular fatigue - determined by a submaximal exercise protocol with intermittent isometric contractions - in two groups of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

NCT05464238,Training in HFpEF-PH,TRAIN HFpEF,Not Yet Recruiting,"Exercise interventions alone or as a component of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program for patients with heart failure (HFrEF and HFpEF) have already shown to reduce the risk of hospitalisations due to HF and improved exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. Two meta-analyses have confirmed the beneficial effects in cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life. The effects of exercise training on systolic and diastolic function remain inconclusive. Due to the positive results of exercise training in HFpEF, cardiac rehabilitation is recommended (Class I, level A) to be integrated into the overall provision of HF care. However, none of these studies focused on concomitant PH in HFpEF.

Exercise training in patients with pulmonary hypertension has already shown to improve exercise capacity, quality of life and peak oxygen consumption, which was confirmed by three meta-analyses and a Cochrane review. Though different diagnostic subgroups have already been enrolled in PH exercise training studies, they mainly included pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

NCT03465072,"Abnormal Vascular, Metabolic, and Neural Function During Exercise in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction",,Suspended,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately half of the heart failure population in the United States. The primary chronic symptom in patients with HFpEF is severe exercise intolerance quantified as reduced peak oxygen uptake during whole body exercise (peak V̇O2). To date, studies have focused almost exclusively on central cardiac limitations of peak V̇O2 in HFpEF. However, in stark contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), drug therapies targeting central limitations have invariably failed to improve peak V̇O2, quality of life, or survival in HFpEF. Emerging evidence from our lab suggests reduced skeletal muscle oxidative capacity may contribute to exercise intolerance in HFpEF patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for peripheral metabolic inefficiency remain unclear. Reduced blood flow (oxygen delivery), and slowed oxygen uptake kinetics (O2 utilization) may both contribute to reduced peripheral oxidative capacity. Importantly, reduced oxidative capacity may result in increased production of metabolites known to activate muscle afferent nerves and stimulate reflex increases in muscle sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) nervous system activity (MSNA). However, to date there have been no studies specifically investigating the contribution of peripheral metabolic and neural impairments to reduced exercise capacity in HFpEF. The overall aim of this proposal will be 1) to identify impairments in peripheral vascular, metabolic, and sympathetic neural function and 2) to assess the ability of small muscle mass (knee extensor, KE) training, specifically targeting these peripheral skeletal muscle deficiencies, to improve aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance in HFpEF.

GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 1: HFpEF patients will demonstrate reduced skeletal muscle oxygen delivery, slowed oxygen uptake kinetics, and elevated resting and metaboreflex mediated MSNA.

Hypothesis 1.1: The vasodilatory response to knee extensor exercise will be impaired in HFpEF patients.

Specific Aim 1.1: To measure the immediate rapid onset vasodilatory response to muscle contraction, as well as the dynamic onset, and steady state vasodilatory responses to dynamic KE exercise.

Hypothesis 1.2: Skeletal muscle oxygen uptake kinetics will be slowed in HFpEF.

Specific Aim 1.2: To measure pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics during isolated KE exercise in order to isolate peripheral impairments in metabolic function independent of any central impairment.

Hypothesis 1.3: HFpEF patients will demonstrate elevated MSNA at rest, and exaggerated metaboreflex sensitivity during exercise.

Specific Aim 1.3: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure MSNA from the peroneal nerve at rest, and during post exercise ischemia to directly assess metaboreflex sensitivity in HFpEF.

GLOBAL HYPOTHESIS 2: Isolating peripheral adaptations to exercise training using single KE exercise training will improve peripheral vascular, metabolic, and neural function and result in greater functional capacity in HFpEF.

Hypothesis 2.1: Isolated KE exercise training will improve the vasodilatory response to exercise, speed oxygen uptake kinetics, and reduce MSNA at rest HFpEF.

Specific Aim 2.1: The assessments of vascular, metabolic, and neural function proposed in hypothesis 1 will be repeated after completing 8 weeks of single KE exercise training.

Hypothesis 2.2: Single KE exercise training will improve whole body exercise tolerance, peak V̇O2, and functional capacity in HFpEF.

Specific Aim 2.2: To test this hypothesis the investigators will measure maximal single KE work rate, V̇O2 kinetics and peak V̇O2 during cycle exercise, as well as distance covered in the six minute walk test.",False,Heart Failure With Normal Ejection Fraction,Other,Exercise training,"Muscle sympathetic nervous system activity, VO2 onset kinetics","Reactive hyperemia, Exercise hyperemia",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,,All,65 Years,85 Years,780.0,1020.0,Older Adult,Na,22,Other,Interventional,Basic Science,STU 082017-038,,2018-02-01,2026-03-01,2026-03-01,2018-03-14,,2025-04-01,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

NCT04407091,"A Study to Assess the Mass Balance Recovery, Pharmacokinetics, Metabolite Profile and Metabolite Identification of [14C]AZD4831",,Completed,"The Sponsor is developing the test medicine, AZD4831, for the potential treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a general term to describe a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, examples of CVD include angina (chest pain caused by restricted blood flow to heart muscle) and heart failure (where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly). AZD4831 is an inhibitor of a protein that has a role in the formation of fatty deposits in arteries (blood vessels that take blood to the body). It is hoped that by inhibiting this action, AZD4831 will help with the management of CVD.

The study involves radiolabelling (labelling the molecule with radioactive 14C) which is used to locate the molecule within the body. The study will try to assess how much radioactivity can be recovered from the urine and faeces (mass balance recovery) after a single oral dose of \[14C\]AZD4831. It will also look to identify the breakdown products (metabolites) of the parent drug. It will additionally determine the rate and route of elimination of \[14C\]AZD4831, along with the level of test medicine in the blood. The safety and tolerability of the test medicine will be assessed. The dose of radiation administered is very low, therefore the risk associated with this is very small.

The study will consist of a single study period involving up to six healthy male volunteers. Up to six male volunteers will receive a dose of 10 mg of the radiolabelled test medicine as an oral solution.

NCT05582044,Exercise Lower-body Negative Pressure in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Recruiting,"The heart is a pump that must both fill and empty effectively to move blood; if it cannot move enough, heart failure may ensue. Approximately half of all adults living with heart failure have a form where the heart stiffens, which impairs its ability to fill. This form of heart failure particularly affects females and older adults. When people exercise, extra blood returns to the heart. The healthy heart can easily fill and move this extra blood to the muscles. However, when the heart's ability to fill is impaired, the extra blood can back up and pool in the lungs. Blood pooling in the lungs makes people feel breathless, although the investigators do not fully understand why, and this form of heart failure has a high risk of hospitalization and death, but few effective treatments are available. Exercise is one of the few treatments that works well if enough exercise is performed regularly. However, many people with this form of heart failure can only tolerate a small amount before stopping due to severe breathlessness, which can put them off from exercising regularly.

The study's goal is to help these people perform more exercise. The investigators will use a novel form of stationary cycling with a plastic chamber around the lower body that seals at the waist. The chamber can apply suction to the lower body during exercise which will reduce how much extra blood returns and prevent the heart and lungs from being overloaded. Participants will attend 5 visits, including 3 where they will perform a submaximal exercise test for as many minutes as possible with or without light suction. In each of these tests, the investigators will record how long they exercise and ask them to rate how breathless they feel. The investigators will also study their breathing pattern, using a mouthpiece and pressure sensor, and heart function, using ultrasound imaging.

NCT03672591,Renal Hemodynamics in Patients With HFpEF,,Completed,"Impaired renal function and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are two often co-existing medical conditions and are known to be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome and increased mortality. The relationship between HFpEF and renal impairment is bidirectional. On the one hand, renal dysfunction has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF. On the other hand, an increase in central venous pressure leading to renal dysfunction by a reduction of renal blood flow (RBF) and perfusion pressure (RPP) as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in patients with HFpEF has been previously described.

In the literature, several studies aimed to investigate the association between renal (dys-) function and HFpEF. In all these studies, renal function was assessed by determination of standard kidney function parameters such as serum creatinine, eGFR and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Constant infusion input clearance technique however offers a more detailed evaluation of renal function and hemodynamics. To the best of knowledge, renal hemodynamics in patients with HFpEF have not yet been investigated by clearance technique. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate renal function and hemodynamics by means of constant infusion input clearance technique with sodium p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and Iohexol in 40 patients with HFpEF. The constant infusion input clearance technique offers an exact evaluation of renal function by measuring (not estimating) glomerular filtration rate and renal hemodynamic parameters such as renal plasma flow (RPF), filtration fraction (FF) and intraglomerular pressure (IGP). These results will be compared to 140 subjects without HFpEF that have participated in various studies and have been analyzed with the same constant infusion input clearance technique performed in the Clinical Research Center of the University Hospital Erlangen-Nuremberg.

Each study visit will involve measurements including:

* Symptom and quality of life questionnaires
* Body measurements such as height and weight
* Blood tests
* Ultrasound scans of the heart (echocardiogram)
* Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the heart
* Exercise components during the scans
* 6 minute walk test

This study will include multiple experimental visits before and after treatment (minimum 7 percent weight loss, between 9-12 months) to understand how increased adiposity and inflammation effects skeletal muscle and cardiovascular health and function and to examine the effect of medically directed weight loss on skeletal muscle health and exercise tolerance.

The objective of this study is to

1. Define the mechanisms by which adiposity impairs exercise hemodynamics, microvascular function, and oxygen transport/utilization in patients with HFpEF.
2. Determine if intensive medically directed weight loss can reduce microvascular inflammation and normalize exercise hemodynamics.
3. Quantify the effect of medically directed weight loss on skeletal muscle function and catabolism.

Hypotheses

1. Perfusion of subcutaneous adipose tissue disrupts blood flow distribution and impairs muscle microvascular perfusion and exercise hemodynamics.
2. Extramyocellular muscular lipid deposition and microvascular endothelial inflammation is associated with reduced capillarity and impaired microvascular perfusions, while intramyocellular triglyceride content is associated with poor skeletal muscle oxidative capacity,

NCT05884346,Association Between Coronary and Peripheral Vascular Injury in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,COROVASC,Unknown,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HPEF, defined as LVEF ≥50%) represents 50% of hospital admissions for heart failure. Although its morbi-mortality is similar to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFPEF), it remains an unknown disease with limited data especially from an etiological point of view. The underlying causes are imperfectly understood, and more than half of the patients have HPEF labeled ""idiopathic.""

A non-hierarchical clustering study of HPEF patients led to the identification of a subgroup of patients (25%) with a predominant coronary vascular phenotype (i.e., a history of coronary stenosis with or without the need for revascularization). In these patients, vascular endothelial dysfunction would play a central role in the development and progression of heart failure.One of the mechanisms leading to HPEF could be a decrease in the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) involved in the relaxation of the cardiac muscle. As the mechanism of action of NO is pleiotropic, a decrease in NO bioavailability could also be observed at the peripheral level, favoring in the long term the development of unfavorable vascular remodeling, for example in the small digital or retinal arteries.Some HPEF patients could thus be distinguished from others by their predominant ""vascular"" profile. The link between HPEF and endothelial dysfunction has been suspected but never clearly demonstrated.

Ultra-high frequency ultrasound is an innovative technology to estimate the remodeling of small distal arteries in a non-invasive way. The investigators propose to use this imaging on digital arteries in HPEF patients and to study the association with known coronary macrovascular damage.The remodeling parameters will be measured and compared in patients with HPEF with or without identified macrovascular coronary disease.This characterization of arterial remodeling on the digital arteries could be a powerful tool for non-invasive screening in the identification of a subgroup of HPEF that is still considered idiopathic.",False,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,Other,Ultrahigh-frequency ultrasound,Digital vascular remodeling by ultrahigh-frequency ultrasound,"Radial vascular remodeling by echo-tracking, Carotid vascular remodeling by echo-tracking, Endothelial dysfunction, Pulse wave velocity, Retinal microvascularization, Calcium score",Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,"Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",All,18 Years,,216.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,84,Other,Interventional,Diagnostic,APHP230214,"2022-A02455-38, 23.00664.000175",2023-06-01,2024-05-01,2024-05-01,2023-06-01,,2023-06-02,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

NCT06338943,Middle-aged Women With Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes and Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,MAPO-HF,Recruiting,"Due to the steady increase in the burden of HFpEF, especially in women, it is an important task to search for new markers and early predictors associated with the development of this disease. Nowadays, the relationship of adverse pregnancy factors with the development of long-term cardiac pathology, in particular, HFpEF, has not been completely established. One of the most significant issue is studying the younger phenotype of women.

The goal of this observational analytical cross-sectional study is to study the relationship of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction in middle-aged women with adverse pregnancy outcomes in the history of pregnancy.

Research question: is there an association between adverse pregnancy factors and the development of HF in middle-aged women?

Objectives

1. To assess the frequency of detection of APOs in the history of pregnancy in middle-aged women, depending on the presence or absence of HFpEF.
2. To compare clinical and anamnestic data, morphological and functional parameters of the heart in middle-aged women with the presence and absence of HFpEF.
3. To establish an association between APOs and the development of HFpEF in the long-term period in middle-aged women.
4. To identify mediators between the presence of APOs and the development of HFpEF in middle-aged women.

NCT04587648,Cardiac Amyloidosis in HFpEF,,Recruiting,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of heart failure cases with heterogenous cause and variable presentations. The diagnosis of HFpEF required clinical signs and symptoms of HF, normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. No treatment has been shown in recent major clinical trials having benefits in these patients. One major reason of the poor response to medical treatment is the heterogeneity of HFpEF, which contains many different underline causes. To identify the underlying causes of HFpEF may improve the diagnosis and treatment in these patients.

Age-related amyloid deposition has first been reported in 1876 and the following autopsy studies showed the prevalence of senile cardiac amyloid is up to 25%. Recently, it has been recognized that the deposits in senile cardiac amyloid are derived from wild-type transthyretin (TTR). Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR CA) is caused by myocardial deposition of misfolded transthyretin protein. There are 2 types of ATTR classified by genetic mutation including wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) and familial cardiac amyloid caused by TTR mutation (ATTRm).

Multimodality techniques have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of the diagnosis of TTR. Among them, 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) scintigraphy is a non-invasive test and it can diagnose TTR from other cause diverse form of cardiac amyloidosis and cardiomyopathy. In the study of Gonzalez-Lopez et al, in 120 HFpEF patients, 16 (13.3%) had positive 99mTc-DPD scan. Four patients with positive 99mTc-DPD scan received endomyocardial biopsy and confirmed cardiac amyloid deposition.

ATTRwt could be an important cause of HFpEF and it was often under diagnosed. A recent study in Spain reported that 13% of patents over age of 60 years with HFpEF and left ventricular wall thickness of 12mm or more had ATTRwt. However, the prevalence of ATTRwt among patients with HFpEF is not well-established in Taiwan and Asia.

NCT06937827,Transitions of Care Clinic (TOCC),,Recruiting,"The transition period from hospital to home is a time of heightened risk for patients to experience adverse events, medication errors, and readmission to the hospital. Patients at the highest risk include older adults and patients with low health literacy, socioeconomic disadvantages, and/or multiple comorbidities. This project proposes to expand the existing Transitions of Care Clinic (TOCC) which was recently introduced in our institution in 2024, to bridge the gap in care between hospital discharge to home and connect discharged patients to their outpatient providers with a focus on patients with heart failure (HF).

The existing TOCC, a multidisciplinary team composed of a pharmacist and a nurse practitioner, seeks to improve the services that are currently being provided to patients and enhance the transitions of care process by providing patients with education, tools, and resources to help manage their chronic disease. With this study, we propose to expand TOCC by offering extensive education to patients via iPad videos and providing them with HF tool kits prior to their discharge. We will also assist with scheduling follow appointments with their outpatient providers and follow up with patients after the appointment takes place to re-evaluate their needs and reinforce self management of heart failure.

By targeting patients being treated for acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), this study aims to facilitate the transition of care, reduce hospital readmissions and improve patients' quality of life and satisfaction. Patients with HFpEF represent a majority of the HF patients that are readmitted at OUMC. HFpEF patients have fewer guideline recommended treatments and represent a vulnerable patient population. The HF tool kits will provide these patients with the essential tools, resources, and log sheets for self-management such as monitoring daily weights, monitoring blood pressure and heart rate.

Researchers are exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can analyse routine heart tests, called electrocardiograms (ECGs), to detect heart problems. These tests can be done using both traditional ECG machines and portable, wearable devices like smartwatches, making it easier for people to monitor their heart health at home.

While AI has shown promise using past data, this study will involve the collection of ECG data and subsequent testing of its accuracy in real-world settings to ensure it works well for both doctors and patients. The goal is to see if AI can identify conditions like heart muscle weakness, valve issues, and high lung pressure from the ECG data of patients. The researchers will also compare AI's detections with other blood tests commonly used to diagnose heart disease.

The AI models that will be used are being tested for research and validation purposes only. They will not be used for clinical decision-making or providing information to influence diagnosis, treatment, or patient care during the study. The AI outputs are not shared with clinicians and will have no impact on the care pathway.

NCT03338374,Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Versus Rate-responsive Pacing in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,PREFECTUS,Completed,"Half of patients with heart failure have normal heart pumping function (Heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction, HFpEF), most commonly characterised by breathlessness on exercise. A number of mechanisms are responsible, but frequently patients are unable to raise their heart rate on exercise. This can be treated by a 'rate-responsive pacemaker' (RRP), which detects exercise and increases the heart rate accordingly. Some beneficial effects on echocardiographic parameters have been reported with exercise programmes. However, evidence based treatment options are limited in this group and therapy mainly relies on water tablets and treatment of blood pressure.

Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a technique using specialised 'biventricular' pacemakers that is well established in heart failure with reduced pump function. Patients who respond to this treatment have lower risk of death and hospitalisation and usually feel better. CRT is not currently used in HFpEF. The PROSPECT trial showed that some patients with relatively preserved heart function exhibited similar benefits to those with poor pump function, but this has not been formally tested. CRT aims to make the heart beat in a more synchronised way. Patients with HFpEF commonly have evidence of reduced heart synchronisation.

The investigators plan to assess the feasibility of using a prospective cohort study to assess the incremental benefit of CRT over and above RRP in patients with HFpEF. 10 patients with HFpEF and insufficient heart rate will be recruited and will undergo exercise testing, heart scanning and symptom questionnaires. A biventricular pacemaker will be implanted and programmed to RRP for 12 weeks before repeating the tests. After this, the investigators will non-invasively programme the pacemaker to CRT for 12 weeks and repeat the functional tests. If incremental benefit is shown with CRT the echocardiograms will be analysed in detail to determine the mechanism of change. The study participants will be invited to continue their involvement in a study extension. This will involve non-invasively programming the pacemakers to optimise their function guided by the results of the echocardiograms in the first two phases of the study. After a further 12 weeks, the functional assessments will be repeated.

The SOLOIST reported the benefits of sotagliflozin in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients hospitalized for worsening of Heart Failure (HF), while the SCORED involved T2DM patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). It is worth noting that not only did the event curves separate within the first week post-treatment, but the effects of sotagliflozin on HF-related outcomes were observed regardless of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) values and did not seem to attenuate with increasing LVEF as seen with empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan. Despite the favorable outcomes, the mechanism(s) of action through which sotagliflozin exerts these benefits remains unclear.

NCT06652763,Manganese-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,MEMRI in HFpEF,Recruiting,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a condition in which the heart cannot fill with blood effectively. As a result, people with HFpEF suffer fatigue, breathlessness, and develop swollen limbs. The condition often requires multiple admissions to hospital and is associated with a marked loss of lifespan.

Despite being so common, very little is known about why people develop HFpEF and there are hardly any known treatments. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major risk factor for HFpEF, and people with both HFpEF and diabetes are at a heightened risk of hospitalisation and premature death. It is unclear why the combination of diabetes and HFpEF is particularly harmful. This may be related to the hearts of people with type 2 diabetes being unable to take up the mineral calcium properly, as well as due to their hearts being less energy efficient. Both of these are vital to heart muscle pumping and filling, but until recently it has not been possible to assess these in humans.

New advances in heart MRI scans, with dedicated scanner techniques and dyes (manganese contrast), now allow extremely detailed pictures of heart structure, function, calcium uptake and energy efficiency, all during the same scan. The investigators will enlist 40 volunteers with HFpEF (20 with T2D and 20 without T2D), and up to 20 healthy volunteers, to undergo a heart MRI scan with manganese contrast to assess calcium uptake and energy efficiency.

Hypertension remains one of the major modifiable risk factors in HFpEF development and progression. The role of aerobic exercise training for blood pressure (BP) reduction is well established, with positive cardiac, vascular, and neurohumoral adaptations all cited as potential mechanisms for improving arterial haemodynamics. However, recent evidence has shown that a specific type of resistance exercise alone, known as isometric exercise (IE), produces greater mean BP reductions than what has traditionally been seen with both aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise training programmes. Indeed, short duration IE training causes significant improvements in both cardiac structure and function, in addition to inducing significant reductions in resting BP in normotensive, pre-hypertensive and hypertensive individuals.

NCT06826963,Feasibility and Effectiveness of Eccentric Exercise in Sarcopenic Older Adults with Heart Failure: a Pilot Study,ECLYPSE-HF,Recruiting,"This study is designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of a 12-week eccentric exercise program for older adults with sarcopenia (muscle loss) or sarcopenic obesity and chronic heart failure (HF). The program aims to improve physical performance, muscle strength, and overall health without causing excessive strain on participants. Eccentric exercise has shown potential benefits for improving muscle function, and this study will help determine if it is a safe and effective option for individuals with heart failure and muscle loss.

Study Goals: The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an eccentric exercise program for older adults with sarcopenia and CHF. The study will monitor physical performance, adherence to the program, and participants' ability to tolerate the exercise, as well as any impact on heart and muscle health.

Study Population: A screening visit will be scheduled to determine if individuals meet the criteria to participate in the study. During this visit, a detailed assessment will be made, and if eligible, participants will sign an informed consent form.

This study will assess whether a 12-week eccentric exercise program can help improve muscle strength, cardiovascular health, and overall physical performance in individuals with HF and sarcopenia. The program will involve exercising on an eccentric bike, which is designed to reduce strain on the heart while providing effective muscle strengthening benefits.

The study will use several physical performance tests to assess the impact of the exercise program, including:

1. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB): Evaluates mobility and strength.
2. 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT): Measures cardiovascular fitness.
3. Handgrip Strength and Leg Strength Tests: Assess upper and lower body muscle strength.
4. Additionally, body composition will be evaluated using tools such as DXA scans and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure muscle mass, fat, and overall health status. The program's adherence and tolerance will be carefully monitored by measuring session completion, intensity, and participant feedback.

Primary Outcomes

Feasibility Measures:

1. Recruitment and Completion Rate: The ratio of participants recruited to those who successfully complete the study, including post-intervention assessments.
2. Session Attendance: The number of training sessions attended out of the total planned sessions.
3. Adherence to Training Volume: The number of prescribed exercises completed by participants compared to the total planned.
4. Program Tolerance: Evaluated by comparing the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) during sessions to the target RPE.

To be considered feasible, the study must meet these criteria: Recruitment \>50%, Follow-up loss \<20%, Median attendance at training sessions \>80%, Median adherence to prescribed volume \>75%, Tolerance to RPE \>70%.

Secondary Outcomes

Effectiveness Measures:

1. SARC-F: A tool for identifying individuals at risk of sarcopenia, based on self-reported issues like weakness and difficulty walking.
2. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA): Evaluates nutritional status to rule out malnutrition, which could affect training outcomes.
3. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE): Assesses cognitive function.
4. Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire: Evaluates how heart failure affects daily life.
5. International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ): Measures physical activity levels at baseline.

In addition to the physical performance tests mentioned, the study will assess muscle mass and fat distribution using DXA scans and BIA, providing a comprehensive view of body composition. Finally, the feasibility of remotely monitoring patients' physical activity to determine the impact of the intervention on their daily lives, specifically in terms of mobility and autonomy is assessed. To this end, patients will be asked to wear a set of five sensors (two on the ankles, two on the wrists, and one on the waist) for at least four days.

NCT06645535,The Gut Microbiota and Metabolites in HFpEF,,Enrolling By Invitation,"Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as a critical public health concern. The annual mortality rate for HFpEF is approximately 15%, accompanied by a re-hospitalization rate of nearly 80%. Survival rates over a 5-year period typically range from 25% to 50%. Existing medications effective against HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have shown no significant effect on HFpEF. Only the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) has demonstrated significant improvements in patient survival and re-hospitalization rates, thus earning a Class IA recommendation in clinical guidelines. HFpEF is characterized as a complex, heterogeneous, multi-organ systemic syndrome primarily associated with risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, coronary atrial disease (CAD), and kidney disease. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate other multi-system disorders closely associated with cardiac diastolic dysfunction to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HFpEF. The human digestive tract harbors a complex and dynamic microbial community known as the gut microbiota, which comprises up to 100 trillion microorganisms and approximately 150 times more genomes than the human genome, often referred to as the ""second genome"" of the human body. Recent years have seen growing recognition and extensive research into the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and development of cardiovascular diseases. In HFrEF patients, there is a significant decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota, along with changes in its composition and structure. Notably, pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter and Candida species exhibit a substantial increase correlating with disease severity, while anti-inflammatory bacteria like Brauteria demonstrate a marked decrease. Furthermore, gut microbiota can influence the host's cardiometabolic traits through the modulation of both its own and host-produced metabolites. HFpEF is increasingly considered a metabolic disease. Comorbidities associated with HFpEF, including obesity, T2DM, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and coronary artery disease (CAD), have been reported to be closely related to gut microbiota. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and HFpEF is still not fully understood. A recent study indicates that indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) could attenuate diastolic and metabolic dysfunction and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in an HFpEF mouse model. Several clinical studies have noted alterations in microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in HFpEF patients. It is now well recognized that targeting the gut microbiome and its metabolites represents a promising novel therapeutic strategy for managing cardiovascular diseases.

The incidence and prevalence of HFpEF has been growing by 10% every 10 years relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

HFpEF is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and patients with HFpEF have similarly high hospitalization rates as patients with HFrEF. Hence, HFpEF poses a substantial global health challenge. Despite its prevalence, HFpEF remains undiagnosed and underrecognized, necessitating a comprehensive approach to both identification and management.

Ensuring successful treatment necessitates early identification of HFpEF. Consequently, a targeted screening strategy has been devised for the identification of HFpEF patients.

NCT07010952,AI-based Echocardiographic Quantification in Heart Failure,,Not Yet Recruiting,"Heart failure (HF) is a clinical complication. About half of HF patients have heart failure with normal systolic fraction (HFpEF), and most of them are elderly women. The other type is systolic heart failure, characterized by a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 (LVEF\<40). The clinical symptoms of HFpEF are very similar to those of low systolic fraction heart failure (HFrEF) with abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction. Generally speaking, the morbidity and severity of HFrEF are higher, and the survival rate is lower. HFpEF is generally difficult to diagnose, so it is critical to find a method to accurately diagnose HFpEF. HFpEF is most commonly diagnosed by echocardiography and biomarkers. In a cardiac ultrasound examination, it is impossible to diagnose HFpEF based on a single parameter of the results. We need multiple examination parameters to gather enough evidence to confirm the existence of HFpEF. These parameters include the mitral inflow velocity pattern, the pulmonary vein flow pattern, changes in flow velocity from the left atrium to the left ventricle, tissue Doppler measurements, and M-mode ultrasound measurements. We train artificial intelligence to distinguish between normal and abnormal cardiac ultrasound images, measure or evaluate all the above parameters, and analyze all the data. We hope that, with the help of artificial intelligence, we can improve the prediction and diagnosis rate of HFpEF.

Simply diagnosing HFrEF requires an LVEF of less than 40%. Diagnosing HFpEF poses significant clinical challenges because no single tool or method can reliably confirm the condition or predict associated hospitalizations. Consequently, diagnosis depends heavily on physician judgment, requiring the synthesis of considerable clinical data and information. Recognizing the heterogeneity of the HFpEF phenotype, phenomapping integrates comprehensive data (clinical history, physiological measurements, biomarkers, ECG, echocardiographic parameters) to stratify patients into distinct subtypes, thereby optimizing classification for improved prognostic prediction. It can be seen from this that HF will rely heavily on artificial intelligence in the future to assist in patient data management and classification diagnosis and further develop clinical prediction models.

Transthoracic echocardiography is essential for the diagnosis of HFpEF according to the current guidelines. The HFA-PEFF and H2FPEF diagnostic algorithms rely on clinical characteristics and echocardiography findings that indicate the presence of diastolic dysfunction.

These diagnostic algorithms are not applicable in remote areas where expert echocardiography cannot be performed due to the absence of modern ultrasound systems and lack of qualified specialists. Therefore, it is important to develop an algorithm to evaluate pre-test probability of HFpEF without echocardiographic markers, so it can be easily used in the primary outpatient care setting by any specialist.

NCT00774709,Karolinska-Rennes (KaRen) Prospective Study of Exercise Stress Echocardiography in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,KaRen,Completed,"Background:

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is common but not well understood. Electrical dyssynchrony in systolic heart failure is harmful. Little is known about the prevalence and the prognostic impact of dyssynchrony in HFPEF.

Methods:

We have designed a prospective, multicentre, international, observational study to characterize HFPEF and to determine whether electrical or mechanical dyssynchrony affects prognosis. Patients presenting with acute heart failure will be screened.

Inclusion criteria will be:

acute presentation with Framingham criteria for heart failure, left ventricular EF ≥45%, BNP \>100 ng/L or NT-proBNP \>300 ng/L. Patients will return in stable condition 4-8 weeks after the index presentation and undergo questionnaires, serology, ECG and Dopplerechocardiography. Thereafter, patients will be followed for mortality and heart failure hospitalization every 6 months for at least 18 months. Sub-studies will focus on echocardiographic changes from the acute presentation to the stable condition and on exercise echocardiography.

Conclusion:

KaRen aims to characterize electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony and to assess its prognostic impact in the HFPEF. The ancillary study of the exercise stress echocardiography sought to improve our understanding of HFPEF and generate answers to the question whether dyssynchrony could be a target for therapy in HFPEF.",False,Heart Failure,,,Echocardiographic parameter,,French Cardiology Society,Fédération Française de Cardiologie,All,18 Years,,216.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",,90,Other,Observational,,CCP 08 / 20- 679,,2008-10-01,2012-10-01,2012-11-01,2008-10-17,,2013-09-30,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

In HF patients, undernutrition is not uncommon and represents one of the most significant determinants of poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, nutritional management is of paramount importance for patients with HF.The basic method of nutritional management is to effectively identify the nutritional status of patients with heart failure, especially in elderly patients with heart failure who are not easy to find in the early stage. Limited data are available regarding the association between CONUT score and prognosis in elder patients with HFpEF, despite its easy availability in routine blood chemistry. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of CONUT score and to compare it with other well-established nutritional indices in HFpEF, a common HF phenotype in the elderly population with coronary artery disease.

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study which were approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of our hospital (TRECKY2021-185). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

NCT05475028,Network Medicine Approaches to Classify Heart Failure With PReserved Ejection Fraction by Signatures of DNA Methylation and Point-of-carE Risk calculaTors (PRESMET),PRESMET,Completed,"Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome, resulting from structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. Effective HF management depends on accurate and rapid diagnosis requiring assessment of symptoms and physical signs in combination with advanced and expensive imaging tools. However, several challenges arise from the traditional symptom-based diagnosis because co-morbidities of HF have similar presentations. This implies the need for a deeper knowledge of mechanistic links among genetic and epigenetic events governing the pathophysiology of HF leading to a novel molecular-based system to differentiate HF phenotypes. Now, it is emerging that the pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFrEF is different, it provides an opportunity to identify biomarker candidates that could aid in HF diagnosis and stratification between these two forms of the disease. The aim of PRESMET project is to perform liquid biopsy strategies to identify novel putative non-invasive epigenetic-sensitive biomarkers that could be used either alone or in combination with established diagnostic tests, such as natriuretic peptide, to help differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF.

NCT04163861,Frequency and Magnitude of Subclinical Systolic Dysfunction by Strain Imaging in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Completed,"Background: Originally thought to be purely due to LV diastolic dysfunction, studies in western countries have suggested that heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is more complex. In patients with HFpEF, LV systolic function is commonly considered normal as the global ejection fraction (EF) is normal. However, the EF reflects only the global cardiac contractile function and does not take the subclinical systolic function into consideration. Therefore more attention should be paid on this subset of heart failure population in which the frequency and magnitude of concomitant subclinical systolic dysfunction has not been clearly defined.

Objective: The principal objective of this study was to assess the global longitudinal systolic function of the LV in patients with HFpEF in a tertiary level hospital with the aim of finding out the frequency and magnitude of impaired subclinical systolic dysfunction by using Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) derived from 2D speckle tracking echocardiography and to see if there is any correlation of GLS with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and BNP level in these patients.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2018 to April 2019. A total of 31 patients with HFpEF (Group I) and 31 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex (Group II) were enrolled in the study by consecutive sampling. Detailed history including NYHA functional class, physical examination, relevant investigations including BNP level was done in patients with HFpEF. 2D echocardiography, color Doppler, tissue Doppler and 2D speckle tracking echocardiography was done in both groups. GLS was obtained in a total of 31 patients with HFpEF (Group I), diagnosed according to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure and compared with GLS of 31 healthy volunteers (Group II), to find out the frequency and magnitude of impaired subclinical systolic function in patients with HFpEF. GLS was also compared with their NYHA functional class and BNP level to find out if any significant relationship is present.

Result: All patients with HFpEF had preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF\>50%) and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. HFpEF patients demonstrated significantly lower GLS compared to healthy controls (14.92 ± 3.16 versus 20.60 ± 1.84). The reduction in LV GLS was statistically significant (p \<0.001). Majority of patients with HFpEF (74.2%) had reduced GLS, when reduced GLS was defined as \> 2SD below the mean value for healthy volunteers, indicating the presence of subclinical systolic dysfunction in majority of these patients. Worse GLS was associated with higher BNP levels in patients with HFpEF when modeled categorically as quartiles (p = 0.044) and also when modeled continuously (Pearson correlation, r = 0.5, p = 0.004), there was negligible correlation between LV GLS and NYHA symptom class when modeled continuously (Spearman's correlation, rs = 0.052, p = 0.789).

Conclusion: Strain imaging detects impaired systolic function despite preserved global EF in patients with HFpEF. Subclinical systolic dysfunction was frequent in the majority of HFpEF patients. Lower LV GLS is associated with higher BNP level. LV GLS was not associated with NYHA functional class.

Accordingly, progress in managing HFPEF in the elderly requires improved understanding of HFPEF pathogenesis with a focus on the impact of co-morbidities. However, the available evidence is insufficient to determine the true prevalence and severity of co-morbidities as well as their impact on both diagnosis and treatment in HFPEF. Therefore there are widespread diagnostic uncertainty without proven therapy!

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. The investigators will study how to improve diagnostic accuracy for HFPEF in elderly patients, despite frequent comorbidities and higher age? How useful is it to add exercise testing and contrast echocardiography as well as biomarker as additional diagnostic tools in elderly HFPEF patients?
2. The investigators will test the hypothesis that HFPEF in the elderly is dominated by multiple co-morbidities that are a major part of the syndrome itself that contribute to the development of HFPEF. This hypothesis implies that the treatment of co-morbidities will improve prognosis.

The investigators' overall goal is to bring about a paradigm shift in managing elderly patients with HFPEF by not only improving diagnosis but also effectively treating co-morbidities that are currently considered predisposing factors to HFPEF. This contrasts with trials during last two decades that only target the heart.

The investigators will pursue the following specific aims:

1. Validate the diagnostic criteria for HFPEF proposed by European Society of Cardiology 2012, and determine the added diagnostic values of exercise testing and contrast echocardiography as well as biomarker for HFPEF in a multi-center study.

In about 50% of patients with symptomatic HF ejection fraction (EF) is preserved (HF-PEF). Once patients develop symptoms, the prognosis is poor with 25% mortality at 1 year and 50% mortality at 5 years. HFpEF is one of the major unresolved areas in clinical cardiology. The diagnosis of HFpEF remains a diagnosis of exclusion and currently no non-invasive measure provides a clear diagnosis.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides non invasive and radiation free evaluation of heart structure and function. New CMR parameters offer the possibility to describe the underlying pathological and physiological changes associated with HFpEF.

The investigators propose to undertake the first systematic comparison between a CMR protocol and invasive haemodynamics as the best possible gold standard, as well as define the histopathological drivers in myocardial biopsies. The investigators will also examine the relations with tissue and serological biomarkers implicated in HFpEF and the role with standard and novel parameters by echocardiography. If successful, this study will provide tools for a reliable and accurate non-invasive characterization of patients with HFpEF, supporting the diagnosis and grading the severity of disease. This study will provide a reference basis for future diagnostic algorithms in HFpEF, both, for CMR and echocardiography, but also for their relative value in comparison to blood markers or invasive testing.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) can help filling this gap in knowledge: on top of providing gold standard measurements for myocardial volume and cellular mass, recent technical advantages mean that this test can assess and quantify left ventricular extracellular volume, fibrosis and microvascular function accurately and non-invasively.

Patients with heart failure (HF) have substantial hemodynamic changes which lead to intestinal hypoperfusion and congestion and eventually change gut morphology, permeability, function and composition of gut microbiota and cause translocation of microbial and endotoxins into the blood stream. Additionally, metabolites derived from gut microbiota modulate the pathophysiology of HF. Patients with HF have intestinal overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria and increased gut permeability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that antibiotic treatment benefits patients with acute coronary syndromes and reduces the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Taking the strong association of gut microbiota with HF into account, it is reasonable to speculate that gut microbiota could contribute to the progression of pre-HF with preserved ejection fraction (pre-HFpEF) to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

NCT06949319,"Stroke Risk Assessment and Markers of Blood Clotting in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF), Who Have Not Received Oral Anticoagulation Therapy (OAC-therapy) Prior to Inclusion",BIO-AF,Recruiting,"Background:

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder worldwide. Globally, there are 37.5 million people with AF. AF increases the risk of death, heart failure, and stroke, which severely affect patients and also lead to high healthcare costs. Around 25% of all strokes are caused by AF, and patients with stroke due to AF tend to have a higher risk of death and more disability compared to stroke patients without AF.

Stroke prevention is, therefore, an important part of AF treatment, in which blood thinning medication has an important role. However, blood thinners increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, it is important to divide patients with AF into different risk groups, known as risk assessment, to figure out who will benefit the most from blood thinners. To be able to divide patients into different risk groups, various stroke risk assessment tools have been developed, such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score and the ABC-stroke score. The most commonly used tool is the CHA2DS2-VASc score, including only clinical risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. The ABC-stroke score, which includes blood markers of heart function, has been proven to outperform the CHA2DS2-VASc score in terms of predicting stroke in AF patients. However, the CHA2DS2-VASc score remains the primary stroke risk assessment tool for AF patients in current guidelines.

After looking at the different risk factors, patients are divided into three groups: low, intermediate, and high risk. High-risk patients must take blood-thinning medication for life, while low-risk patients do not need it. In the medium-risk group, it remains uncertain whether blood thinners should be given or not.

Despite the broad use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score, the score itself has limitations. The score does not include important factors, such as the duration of AF, the size and function of the upper heart chambers, as well as the stiffness of the heart, and markers of blood clotting, which are proven markers of a state that inceases the risk of blood clots. Furthermore, the CHA2DS2-VASc score does not consider whether heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes are well-controlled or not, which could lead to overuse of blood thinners. Therefore, the current risk assessment tools for patients with AF are incomplete, and improvements are needed.

Overall hypothesis:

Overall hypothesis is that the different components of the CHA2DS2-VASc score and ABC-stroke score affect blood clotting markers differently, depending on whether conditions like heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes (modifiable risk factors) are well-controlled or not. Investigators also expect to see differences in blood clotting markers across different stroke risk groups (low, intermediate, and high risk, based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score and ABC-stroke score) in AF patients who have not yet started blood thinning medication. Furthermore, investigators believe that the duration of AF, the size/function of the upper heart chambers, as well as the stiffness of the heart, can reflect an increased risk of blood clots in AF patients.

Overall goal of the study:

The overall goal of the study is to help improve the current tools used to assess the risk of stroke in patients with newly diagnosed AF. This will be done by adding more factors to the current risk assessment tools that reflect an increased risk of stroke, such as the burden of AF, the size/function of the heart's upper chambers, as well as the stiffness of the heart, and using biomarkers that show the blood's ability to clot as a substitute measure for stroke risk.

Methods:

The study is a cross-sectional, single-center observational study and will take place at Esbjerg Hospital - University Hospital of Southern Denmark, involving collaboration between the Unit for Thrombosis Research, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and the Department of Cardiology.

The study population will consist of 150 participants with newly diagnosed AF. The participants must not be taking a specific type of blood thinner, called anticoagulant therapy (OAC-therapy), before being included in the study. The participants will be recruited with the help of the general practitioners (GPs). The general practitioners will be thoroughly informed about the study and the importance of waiting to start OAC-therapy until the participants have been seen at the cardiology outpatient clinic. The participants will be scheduled for a blood test, an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography), and a 7-day heart rhythm monitoring within 4 days after their first meeting with the GP.",False,"Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Atrial Fibrillation (Prevention of Stroke), Atrial Fibrillation New Onset, Non Valvular Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke (in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation), Stroke, Thrombosis",,,"Thrombin generation assessed by lag time, Thrombin generation assessed by peak thrombin concentration, Thrombin generation assessed by time to peak, Thrombin generation assessed by endogenous thrombin potential, Kallikrein generation assessed by lag time, Kallikrein generation assessed by peak kallikrein concentration, Kallikrein generation assessed by time to peak, Kallikrein generation assessed by endogenous kallikrein potential, Concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2","Levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, Concentration of cleaved high-molecular weight kininogen (cHK), Concentration of coagulation factor XII (FXII), Concentration of prekallikrein, Concentration of high-molecular weight kininogen (HK), Concentration of C1-inhibitor, Concentration of coagulation factor VII (FVII), Concentration of coagulation factor X (FX), Concentration of coagulation factor II (FII), Concentration of protein C, Concentration of protein S, Concentration of antithrombin (AT)., Concentration of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), Fibrin turnover assessed by maximum lysis velocity (Vmax), Fibrin turnover assessed by peak optical density (OD), Fibrin turnover assessed by clot lysis, Fibrin turnover assessed by overall hemostatic potential (OHP), Fibrin turnover assessed by fiber diameter, Fibrin turnover assessed by fiber density, Concentration of fibrinogen, Concentration of D-dimer, Concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), Concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), Levels of plasminogen, Levels of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), Levels of plasmin inhibitor (PI), Levels of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), Assessment of atrial fibrillation burden (AF-burden), Assessment of left atrial function index (LAFI), Assessment of underlying heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) using the HFA-PEFF score, Assessment of underlying heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) using the H2FPEF score",Nedim Tojaga,"Esbjerg Hospital - University Hospital of Southern Denmark, Karola Jørgensens Foundation and Foundation for Cardiology in Southwest Denmark., Grosserer L.F.

The panel of screened indications encompasses a broad spectrum of clinically relevant cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and sleep-related diagnostic parameters, which are critical for advanced patient assessment and management. In the cardiovascular domain, the protocol emphasizes the detection and classification of heart failure, assessment of ejection fraction severity, and identification of myocardial infarction, including pathological Q-waves and STEMI. It further addresses diagnostic markers for arrhythmogenic conditions such as QT interval prolongation, T-wave alternans, and ventricular tachycardia, as well as insights into ischemia, atrial enlargement, ventricular activation time, and heart rate turbulence. Additional parameters, such as heart rate variability, pacing efficacy, electrolyte imbalances, and structural abnormalities, including left ventricular hypertrophy, contribute to comprehensive cardiovascular risk stratification.

In the non-invasive cardiopulmonary context, the protocol incorporates metrics like respiratory sinus arrhythmia, cardiac output, stroke volume, and stroke volume variability, providing critical insights into hemodynamic and autonomic function. The inclusion of direct-from-ECG metrics for sleep-related disorders, such as the apnea-hypopnea index, respiratory disturbance index, and oxygen saturation variability, underscores the protocol's utility in addressing the intersection of cardiopulmonary and sleep medicine. This multifaceted approach establishes a robust framework for precision diagnostics and holistic patient management.

The COR 1.0 and COR 2.0 wearables provide multi-lead ECG recordings, with COR 2.0 offering extended capabilities for cardiopulmonary metrics and longer battery life (up to 14 days). COR 2.0 supports tri-modal operations:

(i) Extended Holter Mode: Outputs Leads II and III, mirroring the functionality of COR 1.0 for broader ECG monitoring applications.

(ii) Cardiopulmonary Mode: Adds real-time recording of Lead I, V2, respiratory impedance, and triaxial accelerometer outputs, providing advanced cardiopulmonary insights.

(iii) Real-Time Streaming Mode: Streams data directly to mobile devices or computers via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), enabling real-time waveform rendering and analysis.

The COR 2.0 units are experimental and not yet FDA-cleared.

Primary endpoints include sensitivity (true positive rate) \> 80%, specificity (true negative rate) \> 90%, and statistical agreement with reference devices for cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and sleep metrics. Secondary endpoints focus on predictive values (PPV and NPV) and overall diagnostic performance. The study employs eight distinct sub-protocols (A through H) to address a variety of cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and sleep-related diagnostic goals. These sub-protocols are tailored to specific clinical endpoints, varying in duration (30 minutes to 14 days) and type of data collection. Up to 15,000 participants will be enrolled across multiple sub-protocols. Screening ensures eligibility, and subjects must provide informed consent before participation.

NCT06510270,Dapagliflozin in Reducing Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Not Yet Recruiting,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is becoming the most common cause of heart failure worldwide, in part, driven by a rising prevalence of obesity.

Although generalized and visceral adiposity is important in the pathogenesis of obesity-related HFpEF, there is increasing recognition of the potential role of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in disease pathogenesis. EAT is metabolically active tissue located directly on the surface of the myocardium underneath the visceral pericardium. By virtue of its anatomical interface with the heart and the lack of fascial separation between the underlying myocardium and epicardial fat, locally secreted adipokines directly bathe the surface of the heart and result in underlying myocardial remodeling.

Its position on the surface of the myocardium allows EAT to directly contribute to an increase in total heart size with stretch of the pericardium and results in relative pericardial restraint with constrictive physiology.

EAT is most commonly measured by echocardiography in the parasternal long axis view perpendicular to the right ventricle (RV) to quantify epicardial fat thickness and this has been correlated with worse haemodynamic derangements and adverse outcomes in HFpEF.

Alternatively, cardiac MRI or CT can provide a more complete volumetric assessment of epicardial fat volume and has also demonstrated associations with adverse outcomes and functional metrics in most but not all HFpEF studies.

Very little is understood about the impact of medical modulation of epicardial fat in HFpEF. The first proven agents to improve heart failure hospitalization and quality of life in HFpEF are the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) Although the mechanisms of benefit of these drugs are uncertain, they have demonstrated a reduction in epicardial fat despite only minimal weight loss suggesting a direct lipolytic effect on epicardial fat. The use of SGLT2i has also been associated with reduced incident AF, which may, in part, be due to the reduction in epicardial fat. The diuretic effect of SGLT2i may facilitate a reduction in plasma volume and mechanistic studies have shown that they also promote ventricular mass regression, which may cumulatively decrease pericardial restraint.

By this work we aims To determine whether the addition of 10 mg of Dapagliflozin to a patient with HFPEF can lead to a decrease in epicardial adipose tissue volume, which is a new approach to managing HFPEF or not.",False,Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction,"Drug, Drug, Drug","Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, Loop diuretics, Treatments of associated co-morbidities (e.g Anti-hypertensive, oral hypoglycemic)",Reduction in Epicardial adipose tissue volume,"Change in Body mass index, Recurrent hospital admission by heart failure, Cardio-vascular mortality",Aswan University,,All,18 Years,,216.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,70,Other,Interventional,Treatment,865/11/23,,2024-08-01,2025-08-01,2025-10-01,2024-07-19,,2024-07-19,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789
NCT05002075,Efficacy of an m-Health Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Completed,"Heart failure (HF) portends substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States and the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been increasing. HFpEF is associated with a high morbidity and mortality burden and is projected to be the predominant subtype of HF in the near future. While multiple therapies have proven efficacious for patients with HFrEF, no pharmacological agents have demonstrably been shown to improve outcomes in HFpEF, highlighting the need for novel approaches to HFpEF treatment. Exercise intolerance (EI) is the cardinal symptom of HFpEF, which manifests as dyspnea and fatigue. EI leads to functional deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL), both of which elevate risk of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF. Supervised exercised training is associated with improvements in exercise capacity and QOL in adults with HFpEF. However, supervised exercise has not been widely utilized for the treatment of HFpEF due to logistical and fiscal barriers. Home-based exercise using an m-Health platform is an alternative to supervised exercise that can deliver clinician prescribed exercise interventions and wellness education though monitoring and care coordination. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a patient specific progressive home-based cardiac rehabilitation program leveraging the technology of the m-Health program in improving functional status, exercise capacity, and QOL in patients with HFpEF.",False,Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,Other,m-health cardiac rehabilitation,Change from baseline Standard physical performance battery score at 3 and 6 months,"Peak VO2, 6-minute walk distance, Quality of Life using Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,,All,18 Years,,216.0,0.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,69,Other,Interventional,Treatment,STU-2021-0329,,2021-11-20,2024-05-13,2024-05-13,2021-08-12,,2024-05-16,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

Ejection fraction, a measure of systolic function, is reduced in only about half of all HF patients. Incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has increased in the last 20 years making it a growing public health problem. Currently, most patients admitted to the hospital with heart failure have preserved rather than reduced ejection fractions. However, to date it remains unknown why patients with HFpEF retain salt and water. The hypothesis is that patients with clinical HFpEF have an impaired renal response to salt loading, intravascular expansion and diuretics. Characterization of the salt and water excretory renal response to intravascular salt, fluid and diuretic load in patients with HFpEF will provide insight into the pathophysiology of HFpEF, and may help in the development of novel strategies to target renal sodium handling in patients with HFpEF.

NCT03327649,Neuromodulation to Treat Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction,,Completed,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a leading cause of mortality in the elderly. Outcomes of patients with HFpEF are poor and so far, no treatment has been shown to decrease morbidity or mortality. Recent animal and human studies suggest that a systemic proinflammatory state, produced by comorbidities, including aging, plays a central role in the development of HFpEF, supporting the notion that attenuating the proinflammatory state is an attractive therapeutic target for HFpEF. We have previously shown that low-level transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (tVNS) suppresses inflammation in patients with atrial fibrillation. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effects of tVNS on diastolic dysfunction, exercise capacity and inflammation in patients with HFpEF. Our specific aims include: 1. To examine the effect of intermittent (1 hour daily for 3 months) tVNS on diastolic dysfunction and exercise capacity, relative to sham stimulation, in patients with HFpEF and 2. To examine the effect of intermittent (1 hour daily for 3 months) LLTS on inflammatory cytokines relative to sham stimulation, in patients with HFpEF. The proposed proof-of-concept studies will provide the basis for the design of further human studies using LLTS among populations with HFpEF. In light of the increasing number of elderly patients with HFpEF and the poor success of the currently available treatment options, an alternative and novel approach such as tVNS has the potential to impact clinical practice and improve health outcomes among a large number of patients. It is anticipated that these investigations will contribute to the broader understanding of the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of HFpEF and how its inhibition can be used to provide therapeutic effects. Moreover, it is anticipated that a better understanding of how modulation of inflammation affects one of the hallmarks of HFpEF, diastolic dysfunction, will lead to the development of novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to treat this disease.",True,Heart Failure With Normal Ejection Fraction,Device,low level transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation,"E/e' (Early Mitral Inflow Doppler Velocity to the Early Diastolic Mitral Annulus Velocity), Global Longitudinal Strain","Exercise Capacity, Inflammatory Cytokines, Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire",University of Oklahoma,,All,21 Years,90 Years,252.0,1080.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,52,Other,Interventional,Treatment,8251,,2017-12-12,2021-03-30,2021-09-30,2017-10-31,2022-09-22,2022-09-22,2025-07-22T14:56:11.992789

Recent research from the investigator's group and others have shown that pulmonary hypertension (PH) is highly prevalent in HFpEF, and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is present in both early and advanced stages of HFpEF.

These abnormalities in the RV and pulmonary vasculature are coupled with limitations in pulmonary vasodilation during exercise. There are no therapies directly targeted at the pulmonary vasculature that have been clearly shown to be effective in HFpEF. A recent study by Mayo Clinic Investigators has demonstrated pulmonary vasodilation with dobutamine (a beta 2 agonist) in HFpEF. As an intravenous therapy, this is not feasible for outpatient use.

In the proposed randomized, placebo-controlled double blinded trial, the investigators seek to evaluate whether the commonly used inhaled bronchodilator albuterol (a beta 2 agonist), administered through a high-efficiency nebulizer device that achieves true alveolar drug delivery, improves pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at rest and during exercise in patients with HFpEF as compared to placebo. This has the potential to lead to a simple cost effective intervention to improve symptoms in HFpEF, and potentially be tested in other World Health Organization (WHO) Pulmonary Hypertension groups.

NCT02147613,High Intensity Interval Exercise in Diastolic Heart Failure,,Completed,"Heart failure is a major health concern and is the leading cause of hospitalization among elderly Americans. Currently 5.7 million Americans are estimated to have heart failure and the estimated direct and indirect costs of treating heart failure are approximately $37.2 billion. Approximately 40% of those diagnosed with heart failure will have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). These individuals have significant restrictions in their ability to carry out activities of daily living. Exercise training has been established as adjuvant therapy in heart failure. Although exercise training guidelines for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) are well established, no consensus exercise guidelines exist for management of HFPEF. Aerobic and cardiovascular adaptations are generally greater after high-intensity exercise training; interval-type exercise facilitates this type of training because it allows for rest periods that make it possible for patients with heart failure to perform short (e.g., 1-4 minutes) work periods at intensities that are higher than would be possible during continuous exercise. High-intensity aerobic interval training presents a unique, yet untested, therapeutic modality for the exercise training of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Pilot testing is warranted, results of which may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk, increasing short- and long-term quality of life and survival, and reducing healthcare costs in this patient population. The investigators primary specific aim is to determine the efficacy of a novel, high-intensity aerobic interval exercise training program for improving VO2peak (peak oxygen uptake), endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in patients with HFPEF.

NCT06977477,Managing Congestion in Heart Failure: A Mechanistic Study in Patients With HFpEF,MAGIC-HF,Recruiting,"The goal of this clinical trial (MAGIC-HF) is to understand whether daily remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure using the CardioMEMSTM device and body water levels using a smart scale can improve the management of congestion in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Participants who already have an indication for remote monitoring with CardioMEMSTM (A sensor to be implanted in the pulmonary artery in a minimal invasive procedure) will be enrolled. Every day, patients will measure their pulmonary pressure using CardioMEMS and assess the amount of water in different parts of the body, including the arms, legs, and trunk using the scale BWA ON. The measurements will take about 2 minutes each. Over a period of six months, researchers will monitor these measurements along with regular blood tests to observe changes in heart and kidney function by monitoring biomarkers reflecting the function of these organs.

Managing fluid buildup (congestion) is a major challenge in people with heart failure, and current methods based on clinical signs are not always reliable. Recent research suggests that congestion in heart failure is not only related to pressure but also to changes in fluid volume, and that better monitoring could help tailor treatments more effectively. By combining pressure and volume data, this study aims to help reach a more balanced fluid state (euvolemia) in participants, which could reduce hospital readmissions and improve overall outcomes.

NCT06905405,The Use of Advanced Imaging in HFpEF,,Not Yet Recruiting,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) causes symptoms of breathlessness and leg swelling. It is associated with significant number of hospital admissions and could lead to the patient's death. In HFpEF, the pumping function of the heart is normal but the heart is too stiff to fill properly. The first line investigation is an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography). A number of parameters are assessed that indicate stiffness within the heart or raised pressures within the heart. However, most of these parameters lack sensitivity which can make HFpEF difficult to diagnose. The best test is to invasively measure the pressures in the heart at rest and with exercise in a procedure called heart catheterisation. However, this is invasive and not readily available. As a result, HFpEF is significantly under diagnosed meaning many patients do not get access to disease specific treatment that may improve symptoms and quality of life. There are a number of new imaging techniques that may help us to better identify HFpEF . However, it is not currently known how to best apply them in clinical practice.

In this study, the investigators will recruit patients presenting to the HF clinic at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals who have symptoms of HFpEF but whose diagnosis remains unclear after initial assessment. The impact of their symptoms will be assessed with the use of a quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and a six-minute walk test (6MWT). They will undergo advanced imaging with a specialist echocardiogram and a cardiac MRI scan. If they are found to have features of HFpEF, they will be started on disease specific treatment. All patients will be followed up after six months to see if they have any symptomatic or functional improvement.

NCT03340233,Understanding the Mechanisms of Diastolic Dysfunction,,Withdrawn,"Heart failure is a clinical syndrome marked by breathlessness, even at low levels of exertion, general fatigue, and fluid retention and is estimated to affect 5.1 million people in the United States. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) means that the heart pumps enough blood to the body, but patients still have terrible symptoms. It is estimated to account for about 50% of all heart failure cases. Experts agree that impaired filling of the heart, perhaps due to ""stiffness"" of the heart muscle itself, critically underlies HFpEF. There is currently no clinical technique for measuring heart muscle (myocardial) stiffness; the very definition of ""myocardial stiffness"" remains poorly established. Consequently, the ability to study the mechanisms that underlie HFpEF is virtually non-existent, and limited treatment options will persist without significant advances. The objective of this project is to use an Equilibrium-Material-Stability (EMS) framework that couples patient-specific clinical MRI and heart pressure data in a computational model of the heart to diagnose changes in myocardial stiffness.
