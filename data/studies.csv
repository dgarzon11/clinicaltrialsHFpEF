NCT06594094,"An Open-label, Multidose Dose-escalation Study to Understand the Safety of CRISPR Gene-editing Therapy and Its Long-Lasting Effects in DMD Patients (MUSCLE)",MUSCLE,Recruiting,"Duchenne muscular dystrophin (DMD) is an X-linked, fatal muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene encoding the dystrophin proteins, with symptom onset before age of 6 years in boys. These mutations abolish dystrophin production in the muscle, leading to dystrophin deficiency at the myofiber membrane, continued fiber degeneration, the need for assisted ventilation, respiratory inflammation, loss of walking ability in their teens, followed by respiratory and cardiac decline, and eventually premature death before the age of 30.

Currently, there are only glucocorticoids for the standard supportive therapy of DMD, which can improve disease symptoms but do not change the outcome of the disease, Three antisense oligonucleotide (ASOs) medicines have been approved to treat DMD with exon 45-55 hotspot region mutations. However, they can only restore trace amounts of dystrophin protein, which is insufficient to bring real clinical benefits. Gene replacement therapy has been approved using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver the ""mini-dystrophin"" gene. Yet, mini-dystrophin gene-expression versions of truncated dystrophin functionality are sacrificed and limited.

HG302 uses a single AAV vector to deliver the CRISPR/hfCas12Max DNA editing system in the human DMD exon 51 splice donor site.

We aim to determine the effect of CRT-D or CRT-P implantation in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients.

The reason why we initiated this trial is the lack of evidence-based treatment for the significant number of these patients. In these patients, 5-year mortality remains as high as 20% despite recent therapeutic advances. Based on currently available evidence, because of a significant decrease in mortality due to modern pharmacotherapy, it is not certain which of these patients should receive a CRT-P and who should receive a CRT-D. No dedicated and adequately powered trial has addressed this important question.

We hypothesize that patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤35%, without left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis on LGE-CMR, will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation.

If our hypothesis is confirmed, this could provide evidence for the management of these patients with a significant impact on common daily praxis and health care expenditures.

We aim to enroll 600 patients in the trial. 924 patients are needed to be screened for these 600 patients to be randomized.

Patients with non-ischemic HF visiting an out-patient department and possibly eligible for the trial will have their pharmacotherapy optimized.

Patients with a significant amount of fibrosis will be excluded from the study and treated according to local practice with an emphasis on ICD implantation to prevent SCD.

After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, subjects will be randomized by the physicians who enrolled them in a 1:1 ratio to receive CRT-D or CRT-P implantation.

NCT06887491,The Effect of Dual-tasking Program on Cognitive and Physical Functions and Independence in Activities of Daily Living in Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: a Single-blind Randomized Controlled Trial,DMD-DUAL-FUNC,Enrolling By Invitation,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and frequent developmental, cognitive and behavioral impairments, occurring in one in 5000 live births of boys. DMD is caused by a deficiency of the protein dystrophin, which maintains the structure and functionality of muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin leads to the weakening and eventual death of muscle cells, resulting in reduced muscle strength and impaired motor function. In early childhood, children with DMD may experience delays in basic motor skills such as walking and standing. Later in life, the disease leads to more severe motor dysfunctions, including loss of muscle strength, problems with balance and coordination, and an increased risk of falls.

DMD can also negatively affect cognitive function. Dystrophin is found not only in muscles but also in the brain, and its deficiency in the brain can lead to cognitive problems such as learning disabilities, attention deficits and impaired executive function. These cognitive impairments can affect the academic performance of children with DMD and their functional abilities in everyday life.

In this project, the potential effects of a dual task program designed for children with DMD on physical and cognitive functioning will be examined. Dual task training aims to increase children's capacity to perform two different tasks simultaneously, which may improve the integration of cognitive and motor functions. For example, activities such as counting while walking or answering a question while carrying an object in the hand require children to use both motor and cognitive skills simultaneously. Such exercises can increase coordination between cognitive and motor functions and improve the independence of children with DMD in activities of daily living and their overall quality of life.

The main goals of the program are to produce positive effects on motor skills and cognitive functions, improve balance and coordination, and enable children to move more independently in activities of daily living. Furthermore, this study highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach, providing important insights into how rehabilitation approaches can be developed for individuals with a special condition such as DMD. Collaboration between physiotherapists and occupational therapists plays a critical role in providing comprehensive care for these children.

The methodology of this study included boys with DMD who were admitted to Lokman Hekim University Muscular and Nerve Diseases Application Center. The children will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups, and the children in the intervention group will be enrolled in a dual task performance program for two days a week, one session a day, 45 minutes each session, for eight weeks, with at least two days in between. The effectiveness of the program will be measured using various motor and cognitive assessment tools.

The hypotheses of this study are that dual task training will positively affect motor and cognitive and physical functions in children with DMD, improve balance and coordination, and increase the level of independence of these children in activities of daily living. In conclusion, this project aims to contribute to the development of innovative approaches in the treatment of children with DMD. This approach can improve the overall quality of life of children, as well as support their social participation and educational achievement.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),"Other, Other","Conventional physiotherapy program, Conventional physiotherapy program + Dual task program","Demographic information form, Modified Mini-Mental Test, Dual task assessment, Dynamic Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Child Version (DOTCA-ch), Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test, 6 Minute Walk Test, The Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Pediatric Functional Independence Measure (WeeFIM), ACTIVLIM, The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM) 3.0 Neuromuscular module, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)- Multidimensional Fatigue Scale",,Lokman Hekim Üniversitesi,,Male,6 Years,12 Years,72.0,144.0,Child,Na,16,Other Gov,Interventional,Other,324S053,324S053,2025-04-14,2027-01-15,2027-01-16,2025-03-20,,2025-03-20,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT04287582,The Evaluation of Muscle Activation in Climbing up Stairs Activity in Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Unknown,"Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have difficulties towards the end of the ambulatory period, especially in activities that require lower extremity proximal muscle strength such as walking, climbing stairs, standing up without sitting. Stair climbing / descending activity is a complex activity that requires joint stability, correct muscle synergy and timing. When the literature is examined; It has been observed that the performance of stair climb up and down activity in individuals with neuromuscular disease has been evaluated with various clinical applications. In recent studies, there are surface electromyography (EMG) studies evaluating various aspects of stair climbing and descending activity.

Surface EMG; is a technique for neuromuscular evaluations that is frequently used in both research and clinical applications, noninvasive, and can be used in areas such as neurophysiology, sports science and rehabilitation.

Our study was planned to examine the muscle activations in the lower limb muscles involved in climbing up stairs activity in children with DMD and to compare healthy children with children with DMD and children with different levels of DMD.

Hypothesis originating from the investigation:

H0: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.

H1: There is a difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.

H2: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between children with DMD and healthy children.

NCT02436720,Upper Limb Assessment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,PUL in DMD,Unknown,"The literature on outcome measures assessing upper limbs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is quite scanty. While there have been considerable advances for ambulant DMD boys, no prospective study has so far been devoted to outcome measures in non ambulant patients, with increasing complaints from families and patients. This information appears to be highly important not only for a better understanding of the progression of the disease but also for possible enrollment of patients in future trials.

The aim of this project is to identify outcome measures for non ambulant patients in an Italian population of DMD patients. At least 200 non ambulant DMD boys and adults will be included in the study. All patients will be assessed using the newly developed Performance of Upper limb (PUL) test. This measure will be used at baseline and 6 and 12 months after baseline. This will allow to monitor possible changes over time and the rate of changes in patients with different level of ability and age. As part of this study the investigators will also correlate possible changes in upper limb function with other measures of care and function such as the EK scale.

The investigators aim to assess the suitability of the individual measures in a large number of patients, trying to establish whether whole scales or individual items appear to be relevant across ages and level of abilities. The investigators also aim to assess the suitability of the selected measures in a multicentric setting and the quantity of training required The data collected will also be analysed using Rasch analysis in order to improve the statistical properties of the measures used.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,,assessment of upper limb (PUL),,Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bambino Gesù Hospital, IRCCS National Neurological Institute ""C.

NCT05715957,Follow-up Study on Female Carriers With DMD Gene Variants,,Not Yet Recruiting,"Background Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive allelic disorders caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. There was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. But now, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.

Aim

1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.
2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).
3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).

Methods

This study contains three parts:

Part 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.

In Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see ""3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).

In Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.

Female carriers can decide whether to participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both.

NCT06917430,Muscle MRI Outlining of Neuromuscular Diseases Using Artificial Intelligence,,Not Yet Recruiting,"Background and aim:

Neuromuscular diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting muscle cells, nerves, or the interaction between the two. A common pathological feature of these conditions is the pro-gressive replacement of muscle tissue with fat, which can be visualised using magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI). MRI-based fat quantification serves as a key biomarker for disease characterisation, progression tracking, and treatment assessment. Currently, manual segmenta-tion of MRI scans for fat quantification is very time-consuming, requiring individual muscle delineation. Therefore, an artificial intelligence (AI) model is being developed to automate the segmentation. The aim of this study is to validate this AI model and assess its possibilities and limitations.

Method:

The study is ongoing. Retrospective MRI scans of patients with four different muscle diseases (anoctaminopathy, Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis) are collected and manual delineation used for training the AI-model is being performed.

The researchers hypothesise that some of these misdiagnosed patients carry pathogenic RNA (transcript) disrupting variants that were not identified by DNA sequencing. In fact, DNA sequencing analyses can be negative despite the presence of a pathogenic variant that disrupts RNA splicing or expression, causing a genetic disease. For this reason, RNA sequencing can provide a diagnosis in patients who have not been diagnosed by DNA sequencing, thus putting an end to diagnostic wandering. Thus, as a descriptive prevalence study, the objectives are first to determine the rate of positive diagnoses made by the RNAseq approach in patients with muscle diseases that have not yet been diagnosed, and then to identify the genomic characteristics of the pathogenic variants identified in patients by RNAseq analysis, in order to facilitate the identification of this type of variant in future patients.

Although the development is rapidly progressive , there is variability in the severity of the disease between DMD patients that do not correlate with the type of mutations in the DMD gene. There are no easily measurable biomarkers for monitoring the DMD or moderate form of the disease, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD ) . MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in most cellular processes , and their expression pattern is a signature of the state of a cell . They represent a potential class of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Some are specific for the skeletal myogenesis , and changes in their pattern of expression are associated with muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy. The levels of muscle- specific miRNAs are indeed greatly increased in the serum of DMD and BMD compared to control patients .

The main objective of this is to validate the use of serum muscle-derived microRNAs as biomarkers of DMD patients (compared with healthy subjects). Secondary objectives are i) to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of these miRNAs and the severity of the dystrophinopathy (DMD vs BMD) and also the progression of the disease (longitudinal study), ii) to assess the specificity of these markers for dystrophinopathy (comparison with other patients with muscular dystrophy), iii) to test candidate miRNAs recently identified but not yet analyzed in the serum of patients.

NCT02036463,A Trial of Chronotherapy of Corticosteroids in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Withdrawn,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease for which no curative treatment has yet been identified, making it important to slow progression and improve the quality of life among affected boys and young men. Treatment with corticosteroids is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to the robust observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of ambulation but is associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted in the youngest age group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes are measurable, ages 3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of corticosteroid administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability and at least comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always given in the morning. Furthermore, the trial provides a unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate corticosteroid effects in the young DMD patient, both for efficacy as compared to placebo and as a study of the impact of corticosteroid chronotherapy, or delayed release, on increased tolerability over standard therapy. The main hypothesis is that synchronization of the timing of corticosteroid dosing will improve medication tolerability in children, while maintaining (non-inferiority) the efficacy of corticosteroid. The study also offers a unique opportunity to measure several biomarkers as well as novel genetic modifiers that may further impact the response to corticosteroid in DMD.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),"Drug, Drug","Prednisone, Placebo",Safety,"Time to walk/run 50 meters, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)",Ann & Robert H Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,Children's National Research Institute,Male,3 Years,6 Years,36.0,72.0,Child,Phase2,0,Other,Interventional,Supportive Care,CINRG0513,IND #121239,2014-11-01,2015-02-01,2015-02-01,2014-01-15,,2015-02-18,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165
NCT05601986,Motor Imagery on Children With DMD on Gait and Balance Functions,,Recruiting,"The most common muscular dystrophy among pediatric neuromuscular diseases is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). There is no consensus on a standardized physiotherapy and rehabilitation program or exercise prescription in DMD. Motor imagery (MI) is defined as visualizing motor activities in one's mind without performing any movement. There are studies examining the effectiveness of motor imagery in stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's, peripheral facial paralysis, and phantom pain. This study is aimed to examine the effect of motor imagery on gait and balance functions in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Boys residing in Istanbul Turkey, between the ages of 5 and 12, with a diagnosis of DMD who have not lost their ability to ambulate independently will be included in the study. The included individuals will be divided into two groups due to randomization: Group A (Control Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program) and Group B (Additional Motor Imagery Training to Intervention Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program). While the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program is applied to the participants in Group A with 40-minute sessions on 2 non-consecutive days of the week for 8 weeks, the participants in Group B will receive an additional 25-30-minute motor imagery program to the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program. Participants were tested with Kinovea Gait Analysis, Timed Up and Go Test, 2 Minute Walking Test, Motor Function Rating Scale for Neuromuscular Diseases, timed performance tests, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Pediatric Fear of Fall Questionnaire (Ped-FOF) before and after the program. will be evaluated later. IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) statistical program version 22.0 will be used for statistical analysis. The conformity of the variables to the normal distribution will be determined by the ""Shapiro-Wilk Test"". If the variables show normal distribution, the variation within the group will be analyzed with the ""Paired Sample T Test"", if not, the ""Wilcoxon Test"" will be analyzed.

The progressive muscular weakness leads to the development of scoliosis soon after the child has become unable to walk. The muscular weakness and scoliosis also affect the pulmonary function of these children. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) have been used to determine ""pulmonary fitness"" prior to surgery as a way to determine how well or if the child will tolerate surgery. Children with poor results on the PFT are determined to be too fragile to tolerate such a large operation. The physicians conducting this study feel that the PFT may be inaccurate and that this may not be the best single test to determine ""pulmonary fitness"".

NCT06574919,Clinical and Functional Assessment of Patients With Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies in Sohag University Hospital,,Recruiting,"Muscular Myopathies are a heterogenous group of inherited muscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Historically, these disorders are difficult to treat. In the last three decades, there is a great progress in molecular and genetic basis of these disorders; early diagnosis is achievable with proper clinical recognition and advanced genetic testing \[1\].

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular muscular X-linked recessive disorders that belong to a group of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that placed in the middle of short arm of X chromosome \[2\]. Mutation in this gene lead to absence of dystrophin or structural defects of this protein. The lack of functional dystrophin impairs the structure and function of myofibers which are essential for physiological growth of muscle tissue \[3\].

The non-dystrophic myopathies are a group of inherited myopathies defined by distinctive static histochemical and/or characteristic ultrastructural changes on muscle.

The nomenclature of dystrophic myopathies can be confusing as some of them are classified by age of onset of symptoms (e.g., congenital muscular dystrophies), whereas others are classified by distribution of weakness (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, distal myopathies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), by characteristic clinical features (e.g., myotonic dystrophy), by the name of the causative gene (e.g., GNE-myopathy, dystrophinopathies), whereas others are named after the physician first describing the disease (i.e., Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy or Bethlem myopathy) or can be subdivided in an entirely different way (i.e., the subgroups of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies which were named according to their mode of inheritance and order of publication) \]4\[ Several aspects need to be taken into account in order to establish a clinical diagnosis; these features include but are not limited to the severity of the muscular wasting, as well as its distribution, and the accompanying symptomology, biochemical, hematological, physical, and neurological investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Moreover, if the gene defect is established, diagnosis can also be confirmed by gene testing \]5\[

Muscle biopsy lacks of typical dystrophic features such as increased conjunctive endomysial tissue, necrosis, and regeneration and shows one or more characteristic histological features. Based in pathological descriptions, the main non-dystrophic myopathies were described during the last century, taking into account the age of onset and the structural or ultrastructural markers \[6\].

Certain genes, in particular those with large sizes (TTN, RYR1, NEB), may present with different clinical and histological phenotypes and therefore their related myopathies be classified within different groups \[7\].

It is useful to know that other genetic myopathies may mimic non-dystrophic myopathies. This is the case of certain metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies that may show very selective muscle weakness. The description of these disorders goes beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it may be useful to take into account at least three examples, Pompe disease, the glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), and TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, because they may present as congenital or later-onset non-dystrophic myopathies, may show particular muscle imaging abnormalities, and may be treatable \[8; 9\].

Understanding the clinical and molecular characteristics of non-DMD is crucial for several reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling and family planning. Second, identification of the specific genetic mutation allows for the potential development of targeted therapies in the future. Finally, characterization of the clinical course of different non-DMD can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.",False,Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies,,,Clinical and Functional Assessment of patients with Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies in Sohag University Hospital,,Sohag University,,All,2 Years,18 Years,24.0,216.0,"Child, Adult",,30,Other,Observational,,Soh-Med-24-07-15MS,,2024-08-01,2025-08-01,2025-08-01,2024-08-28,,2024-08-28,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT06124196,Wearable Technology to Evaluate Hyperglycemia and HRV in DMD,,Recruiting,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that causes muscle wasting, cardiopulmonary failure, and premature death. Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD-CM, now the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids (GCs), sarcopenia, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.

The goal of this remote study is to evaluate rates of hyperglycemia in individuals with DMD compared to control participants using continuous glucose monitors, and to determine the relationship between hyperglycemia and heart rate variability.

NCT01521546,Eplerenone for Subclinical Cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,E-SCAR DMD,Completed,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common muscular dystrophy, leads to skeletal and cardiac muscle damage. Treatment of pulmonary complications has improved survival; however, heart muscle disease or cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death, typically by the third decade. Although myocardial changes begin early, clinically significant heart disease is rarely detected in the first decade of life. Consequently, DMD cardiomyopathy frequently goes unrecognized (and untreated) until advanced (and irreversible).

Current DMD cardiovascular care guidelines recommend beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) when decreased ejection fraction (EF) is noted by echocardiography (echo); however, this strategy has not significantly improved outcomes. Our team has recently made a breakthrough in a mouse study, showing in a model that causes the same heart muscle disease in humans with DMD adding an old medicine traditionally used for high blood pressure and late-stage heart failure can actually prevent heart muscle damage. Because of this drug's proven safety in both children and adults, it is ready to be studied immediately in an RCT in patients with DMD to hopefully show, as we did in mice, that we can prevent the devastating consequences of heart muscle damage.",True,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"Drug, Drug","eplerenone, placebo",12-month Change in Myocardial Strain,,Subha Raman,Ballou Skies,Male,7 Years,,84.0,0.0,"Child, Adult, Older Adult",Na,42,Other,Interventional,Treatment,2011H0251,,2012-02-01,2016-06-01,2016-06-01,2012-01-30,2015-05-27,2016-11-08,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT05559710,Motor Imagery in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Completed,"Motor imagery (MI) can be defined as a dynamic process in which the person is mentally stimulated without performing the given motor movement. Studies of imagery; demonstrated that it alters a person's ability to learn, performance skills, and important cognitive skills (self-efficacy, self-confidence, effort, motivation). In recent years, it has been shown that motor imagery techniques are used for therapeutic purposes as a current neurorehabilitation approach and that imagery can have positive effects on improving motor activity and functions. However, it has been reported that the biggest difficulty in the use of imagery techniques is the inability to determine to what extent the individual can perform mental representation of movements. For this reason, it is thought that it is necessary to evaluate the motor imagery ability first in order to identify the patients who are suitable for motor imagery training. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) is a motor imagery questionnaire developed for individuals with limited mobility for different reasons. The questionnaire assesses both the visual and kinesthetic dimensions of motor imagery. of the KVIQ; It has also been shown in the literature that it is a valid and reliable questionnaire that enables the appropriate evaluation of motor imagery in different neurological disease groups such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, the literature When examined, no evidence was found about the motor imagery ability of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is foreseen that KVIQ will be especially suitable for patients with DMD of different functional levels, since all its items have been developed to be applied to people with limited physical mobility or physically disabled people in a sitting position.

NCT02421523,Strength Training in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Completed,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that causes muscle breakdown, weakness, and eventual death. Over the last 40 years parents have received little guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function. It is well known that high intensity exercise and eccentric contractions can result in muscle damage in dystrophic muscle, yet the absence of muscle loading will conversely result in muscle wasting. Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider its implementation in boys with DMD.

The goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been adequately explored using human subjects.

Its presence in maternal plasma has allowed development of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single-gene disorders (SGD-NIPD). This can be performed from 9 weeks of amenorrhea and offers an early, safe and accurate definitive diagnosis without the miscarriage risk associated with invasive procedures. One of the major difficulties is distinguishing fetal genotype in the high background of maternal cfDNA, which leads to several technical and analytical challenges. Besides, unlike noninvasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy, NIPD for monogenic diseases represent a smaller market opportunity, and many cases must be provided on a bespoke, patient- or disease-specific basis. As a result, implementation of SGD-NIPD remained sparse, with most testing being delivered in a research setting.

NCT06337669,Characterization of DupEx2 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,DMDDup2,Recruiting,"To characterize the clinical phenotype and possible predictive/prognostic factors of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to duplication of exon 2 (Dup2). Specifically, we aim 1) to describe the progression of motor, respiratory and cardiac function; 2) to enquire if the phenotypic spectrum of Dup2 is milder than classic DMD, 3) to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize DNA breakpoints to correlate with the phenotype; 4) to collect material for future proteomic/transcriptomic studies.

Background/Rationale DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene and in 11% of cases is due to duplications. The most promising therapeutic approaches include mutation-specific therapies. Notably, there is increasing evidence that specific groups of mutations may underlie different disease trajectories compared to the ""average"" DMD population. It is thus mandatory to have more information on genotype-phenotype correlations and patterns of progression related to different genotypes.

Dup2 is the most common DMD duplication and the only one for which a AAV-mediated exon skipping study is ongoing. Despite most case series and databases ascribe Dup2 to severe phenotype, our preliminary findings sustain that these patients have collectively a milder progression of the disease and in 1/3 of cases a significantly milder phenotype. Moreover, our attempts to reveal mechanism involved in attenuating the phenotype would confute the hypothesis of alternative spicing transcripts as previously described for DMD with deletion of exon 2.

Research design and methods Clinical information regarding a cohort of 26 Italian Dup2 patients will be collected. Differences in time to loss of ambulation compared to a DMD control group will be achieved. Finally, we will retrieve DNA for correlative WGS studies.

NCT01519349,Follistatin Gene Transfer to Patients With Becker Muscular Dystrophy and Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis,,Completed,"The investigators are performing a gene therapy clinical trial in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) patients. Both of these conditions have an important common feature: loss of ability to walk because of weakness of the thigh muscles. The investigators plan to do a gene therapy trial to deliver a gene to muscle called follistatin (FS344) that can build muscle size and strength. If successful, the investigators can increase the size of the thigh muscle and potentially prolong a patient's ability to walk. The gene will be carried into the muscle by a virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV). This virus occurs naturally in muscle and does not cause any human disease, setting the stage for its safe use in a clinical trial.

Presently there is no treatment that can reverse Becker muscular dystrophy or sporadic inclusion body myositis. Only supportive care is currently possible.

In this study, subjects with either of these diseases will have shots of the follistatin gene injected directly into thigh muscle on one (first cohort) or both legs (2nd and 3rd cohort). One hundred and eighty days following the gene delivery, the muscle will undergo biopsy to look closely at the muscle to see if the muscle fibers are bigger. Between the time of the gene transfer and the muscle biopsy, patients will be carefully monitored for any side effects of the treatment. This will include an MRI of the thigh muscle before treatment and at day 180 following treatment. Blood and urine tests, as well as physical examination will be done on the subjects during the screening visit and on days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 to make sure that there are no side effects from the gene injections. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks post-biopsy.

NCT02037243,Disgust and Shame Based Safe Water and Handwashing Promotion,,Completed,"An estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5 years die from diarrheal disease each year. Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to warrant being rolled out at scale.

Research into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be rigorously tested.

The investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.

1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment
2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand Washing
3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment
4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand

This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.

Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.

At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.

In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products.

NCT02835079,Treatment Effect of Tamoxifen on Patients With DMD,,Completed,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births. The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.

In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.

Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:

(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.

In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Also, a small compassionate cohort of 3 boys, treated for 6 months with Tamoxifen, yielded very encouraging results.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,Drug,Tamoxifen,6-minute walk distance (6MWD),North Star assesment(NSAA),Hadassah Medical Organization,,Male,5 Years,16 Years,60.0,192.0,Child,Phase1,19,Other,Interventional,Treatment,DMDTAM001-HMO-CTIL,,2016-11-01,2020-11-01,2020-11-01,2016-07-15,,2022-07-25,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT06093100,Wearable Technology to Evaluate Hyperglycemia and HRV in DMD - Longitudinal Aim,,Recruiting,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that causes muscle wasting, cardiopulmonary failure, and premature death. Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD related CM. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids, low muscle mass, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.

In this Aim of the study, the investigators will assess the utility of remote wearable technology to predict changes in traditional metrics of metabolism and cardiac function. In this pilot study, 10 individuals with DMD will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at baseline and two years. The investigators will remotely assess glycemia (using continuous glucose monitors), HRV (using extended Holter monitors), and activity (using accelerometers) every 6 months over the 2 years and evaluate if changes in wearable metrics predict changes in CMR and OGTT.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,Device,wearable technology,"Rate of hyperglycemia, Standard deviation of the mean R-to-R segment (SDANN)","Coefficient of variation on CGM, Rate of significant hyperglycemia, Activity level, Standard deviation of normal R to R intervals (SDNN), Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Insulin sensitivity",Vanderbilt University Medical Center,,Male,10 Years,,120.0,0.0,"Child, Adult, Older Adult",,10,Other,Observational,,231407,,2024-07-10,2029-12-01,2030-12-01,2023-10-23,,2024-09-19,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT01981915,Optimum Insufflation Capacity in NMD,,Completed,"Patients with underlying neuromuscular disorder (NMD) often suffer from weakness in the inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital. Therefore, secretion and cough management is a mandatory part of the therapeutic concept for treating patients with neuromuscular disease.

The therapeutic efficacy of the Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver(LIA) integrated in the ventilator VENTIlogic LS-plus manufactured by Weinmann GmbH+Co KG was studied in a pilot study carried out by the Dep. for Pediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at the University Hospital of Essen/Germany in cooperation with Research \& Development at Weinmann GmbH \&Co KG, Germany . The objective of the pilot study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of LIAM as a cough support function in patients with neuromuscular disease and indications for mechanical ventilation.

We hypothesized that i) a certain insufflation maneuver pressure may be optimal to achieve the highest individual peak cough flow and ii) that this pressure is below the pressure needed to achieve the maximum insufflation capacity. We define the lowest insufflation capacity at which the best individual PCF can be achieved as optimum insufflation capacity (OIC). The study was performed using two different techniques in order to demonstrate that findings are not dependent on maneuver details but are rather based on effects of maneuver pressure. The protocol was limited to techniques which do not require breath stacking: i) insufflation with an Intermittend Positive Pressure (IPPB) device and ii) with the VENTIlogic LS using LIAM.",False,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency","Procedure, Procedure","IPPB, LIAM",insufflation capacity,Peak cough flow,Universität Duisburg-Essen,Weinmann Geräte für Medizin GmbH + Co.

NCT06103006,Remote Physiotherapy to Protect Physical Health in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Completed,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive loss of motor function, respiratory failure, and cardiomyopathy required regular physiotherapy. With the outbreak of the pandemic rehabilitation centers that make up the weekly physiotherapy routine of children with disabilities have slowed down or even stopped their activities. So DMD who have additional diseases such as respiratory muscle weakness, spinal deformity, obesity, and cardiac dysfunction have also been negatively affected. The 'telerehabilitation' method, which is well planned and prepared for the abilities and needs of patients and caregivers, is seen as a good option at this point.

Studies, reporting the feasibility and safety of telerehabilitation in joint replacement, multiple sclerosis, and post-operative conditions, report that the length of stay was reduced, there was access to the same level of service regardless of the distance, and there was no travel cost. Despite these advantages, the framework and applicability of telerehabilitation programs have been investigated limited and not focused on effectiveness of telerehabilitation in patients with DMD.

According to the current knowledge, telerehabilitation in DMD is a subject that needs to be investigated in terms of its benefits. So, in this study, it was aimed to show the telerehabilitation's feasibility and its effects on performance level, endurance, fall frequency, pulmonary functions, and satisfaction level with the program in individuals with DMD.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,Other,Telerehabilitation,"Endurance, Modified Upper Extremity Performance Test","10 Meter (m) Walking Test, Stand Up from the Supine Position Test, Single Breath Count (SBC), Patient Satisfaction Survey, Brooke Upper Extremity Scale, Brooke Lower Extremity Scale, Frequency of falling",Lokman Hekim Üniversitesi,,All,5 Years,26 Years,60.0,312.0,"Child, Adult",Na,42,Other Gov,Interventional,Treatment,003/2021,,2021-01-01,2022-01-01,2022-02-10,2023-10-26,,2023-10-27,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

Supportive care has been shown to reduce complications from muscle disease and improved survival in some cases. However, there has been limited research to evaluate interventions that may improve quality of life (QoL) with this patient group. The QoL of those with MD is not just affected by the severity of their MD but also a variety of psychological variables. Based upon the knowledge of these psychological variables the investigators feel that a particular type of psychological intervention known as ""acceptance and commitment therapy"" (ACT) could potentially improve QoL in those with MD.

NCT06412328,Psychoeducation Program for Parents of Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,Enrolling By Invitation,"Having and caring for a child with disabilities brings emotional, social and economic difficulties for many families. Families may experience many physiological and psychological problems due to the stress and anxiety they experience. In addition, it is seen that families with children with disabilities give up their existing roles, reduce their participation in social activities, and reach stagnation in their social lives. Mothers are affected psychologically more than fathers and feel lonely. It is stated that mothers believe that they cannot afford everything in the face of the responsibilities they carry and accordingly, they experience emotional and psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness and tantrums.

Living with a child with a disability causes family members to experience different emotions as mentioned above; families may frequently experience fear, anxiety, guilt, anger and depression. It is reported that mothers of children with DMD experience depression, anxiety about the future and uncertainty more than mothers of healthy children. Families of children with DMD reported that they felt tired and fatigued during the process of caring for the child and had difficulties in participating in social activities and allocating time for themselves. Most of these families stated that they needed psychological and social support. Therefore, it is important to address the psychiatric aspects of families with children with DMD during the disease process. Parental health contributes positively to the health and adaptation of the family in general. Examining the psychiatric symptoms caused by the problems experienced by families related to DMD and how they cope with this stress will be useful in evaluating and addressing these families. In addition, the social support that families with children with disabilities receive from their immediate environment and institutions is also an important issue. It has been reported that social support from relatives, friends, neighbors, organizations and communities increases the psychological resilience levels of families, they feel that they are not alone in the face of problems, and their anxiety levels decrease. In the literature, it is generally mentioned that when the culture of pediatric care is supportive and family-oriented, the care of the patient will undergo a change when transitioning from pediatric care to the adult period. However, studies evaluating the problems experienced by families in the care of patients with DMD, psychiatric symptoms, ways of coping with stress and perceived social support are insufficient. It is important to evaluate the problems experienced by parents in the families of children with DMD in developing skills to cope with the disease process and disease-related problems, and then to provide training in these areas. Because if parents, who are in the role of caregivers, are equipped with knowledge and skills in this context, they will provide better care and be more useful to their children with DMD.

In line with this information, the aim of this study was to evaluate the problems experienced by parents of children with DMD, psychiatric symptoms, coping skills with stress and the level of social support they perceive and to implement a psychosocial support-based psychoeducation program related to these areas.",False,"Psychoeducation, Parents, Psychological Wellness, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",Other,Psychoeducation,"Demographic information form, Brief Symptom Inventory, Coping with stress scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support MSPSS",,Lokman Hekim Üniversitesi,,All,18 Years,65 Years,216.0,780.0,"Adult, Older Adult",Na,26,Other Gov,Interventional,Supportive Care,2023109,,2023-06-21,2024-08-29,2026-02-28,2024-05-14,,2025-03-28,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165
NCT01070511,Tadalafil in Becker Muscular Dystrophy,,Completed,"Summary for Patients: This study, funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is intended to build on recent findings published in the journal Nature showing beneficial effects of tadalafil (also known as Cialis) in mice with an animal version of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Only two doses of tadalafil improved muscle blood flow, allowing the dystrophic mice to perform more exercise with less muscle injury. This new short-term clinical trial will move the testing from animals to human patients with Becker muscular dystrophy and examine the effects of acute tadalafil dosing on muscle blood flow during a bout of exercise. Patients will take two doses of tadalafil prior to exercising. Then doctors will measure whether muscles receive increased blood flow and therefore are better protected during exercise.

Scientific Hypothesis: In patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (particularly those with dystrophin gene mutations between exons 41-46), loss of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase engenders functional muscle ischemia and thus muscle edema after an acute bout of exercise. The investigators further hypothesize that PDE5A inhibition, which boosts nitric oxide-cGMP signaling, constitutes an effective new countermeasure for these patients.",False,Becker Muscular Dystrophy,"Drug, Drug","Tadalafil, Placebo","Reflex decrease in muscle tissue oxygenation (i.e., adrenergic vasoconstriction) during rhythmic handgrip exercise measured by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR).",Change in forearm muscle water content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,Muscular Dystrophy Association,Male,18 Years,55 Years,216.0,660.0,Adult,Phase4,48,Other,Interventional,Basic Science,MDA 158944,,2010-01-01,2012-12-01,2012-12-01,2010-02-18,,2013-08-20,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

Gene therapy by exon skipping or stop codon read-through and cell therapy are at the stage of clinical assays with very promising results. Nevertheless, they will not allow a complete cure of DMD patients and they will concern only specific types of mutations. It is therefore crucial to develop other therapeutic strategies related to the natural history of the disease and targeted not on the dystrophin itself, but on the consequences of its absence.

Another crucial pathophysiological pathway in DMD is muscle cell calcium homeostasis, particularly via the ryanodine recepteur (RyR1).

Our study focus on the relationship between endomysial fibrosis, abnormal inflammation response and calcium homeostasis dysfunction which are not entirely established in DMD.

The identification of the biological mechanisms that play a role in the severity of the phenotype, particularly endomysial fibrosis, should allow the development of targeted pharmacotherapy as a complementary strategy for the future treatment of DMD.",False,Duchenne Muscular Distrophy (DMD),Other,Muscle biopsy,"Quantification of endomysial fibrosis, quantification of the muscle inflammation",,"University Hospital, Montpellier",,All,2 Years,15 Years,24.0,180.0,Child,Na,50,Other,Interventional,Basic Science,8948,,2012-11-07,2021-01-01,2021-01-01,2013-04-04,,2020-02-07,2025-05-19T07:13:19.076165

NCT06861270,Estimation of Non-Reimbursable Costs for Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in France,CouDuMyo,Recruiting,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a chronic neuromuscular disorder affecting approximately 150 to 200 newborns annually, predominantly males, and is characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness due to a complete absence of dystrophin. DMD presents a severe phenotype, with life expectancy typically extending into the third decade. Data on healthcare utilization and associated costs for DMD patients, particularly within the French healthcare context, remain limited. The EPARDYS study aims to examine the care pathways of these patients using data from the Banque Nationale des Données Maladies Rares (BNDMR) and the Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS), enabling a detailed characterization of patient demographics, healthcare utilization patterns, and associated costs.

However, only direct costs eligible for reimbursement under the Affection Longue Durée (ALD 100%) scheme can be evaluated. Additional resources are consumed by DMD patients, particularly for medical care that falls outside the scope of reimbursement. Furthermore, the high level of dependency in these patients may lead to the need for home adaptations or other expenditures outside the healthcare domain but linked to the disease. Informal caregiving also plays a significant role.

These additional family-incurred costs must be considered. The CouDuMyo study will aim to estimate all relevant cost components from a societal perspective, considering both minors and adults, whether they attend school or work. The medico-social aspect of care, along with the collection of data on aids and benefits received, will offer insights into the nature of the support available to families in France. The knowledge gained regarding non-reimbursable, disease-related costs according to patient characteristics will provide a comprehensive view of the financial burden borne by patients and their caregivers. This assessment is particularly relevant in the context of emerging therapies, which may reduce these associated costs.

NCT01350154,"Effect of Modulating the nNOS System on Cardiac, Muscular and Cognitive Function in Becker Muscular Dystrophy Patients",,Completed,"This study is done to evaluate whether treatment with the drug sildenafil (Revatio®) can improve muscular, cardiac, cerebrovascular or cognitive function in patients with Beckers muscular dystrophy when compared to placebo (inactive medication). The study is based on the recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Adamo et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with Becker dystrophy.

In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction.

NCT00592553,Phase 2B Study of PTC124 (Ataluren) in Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD/BMD),,Completed,"DMD/BMD is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of DMD/BMD in approximately 13 percent (%) of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 2b trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of ataluren in boys with DMD/BMD due to a nonsense mutation.

As there is increasing evidence that specific groups of mutations may have different progression of the disease, it has become mandatory to obtain more detailed long-term information about the patterns of progression related to different genotypes. Natural history of DMD boys carrying deletions has been more studied and less is known about boys carrying small mutations that represent 20% of DMD patients.
