Stair climbing / descending activity is a complex activity that requires joint stability, correct muscle synergy and timing. When the literature is examined; It has been observed that the performance of stair climb up and down activity in individuals with neuromuscular disease has been evaluated with various clinical applications. In recent studies, there are surface electromyography (EMG) studies evaluating various aspects of stair climbing and descending activity.

Surface EMG; is a technique for neuromuscular evaluations that is frequently used in both research and clinical applications, noninvasive, and can be used in areas such as neurophysiology, sports science and rehabilitation.

Our study was planned to examine the muscle activations in the lower limb muscles involved in climbing up stairs activity in children with DMD and to compare healthy children with children with DMD and children with different levels of DMD.

NCT05281120,Effects of Low-level Mechanical Vibration on Bone Density in Ambulant Children Affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked recessive disorder due to a mutation of the dystrophin gene (Xp21). Dystrophin is a sarcolemmal protein of skeletal and cardiac muscle, and its absence causes progressive muscle degeneration and substitution with fat and connective tissue. The progressive muscle degeneration leads to loss of autonomous walking before the age of 15 years and death for cardiac and/or respiratory failure.

Before starting treatment, patients will have evaluations of muscle strength and general well being. Two muscle tissue samples will be taken by needle biopsy, under local anesthetic and sedation. Because of potential risks of hearing loss and kidney toxicity associated with gentamicin, patients will also have a hearing test and blood and urine tests for kidney function before starting treatment. (Currently, gentamicin is commonly prescribed for serious infections of the lungs, heart, and digestive and urinary tracts; adverse effects of hearing loss and kidney toxicity can occur with excessively high drug doses.)

Patients will be hospitalized during drug treatment. Gentamicin will be given intravenously (through a vein) once a day for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected daily to monitor drug levels and determine dosage adjustments, if necessary. Urine samples will be collected to assess kidney function. Hearing tests will be done on days 7 and 10.

NCT00159250,Safety and Efficacy Study of Antisense Oligonucleotides in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle degenerative disorder, arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene. Antisense therapy with the use of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) has the potential to restore effectively the production of dystrophin, the defective protein, in \>70% of DMD. This could result in increased life expectancy through improved muscle survival and function. Recent scientific research has demonstrated the potential of this technique to skip mutated dystrophin exons, restore the reading frame and generate functional dystrophin protein. Having demonstrated proof-of-principle in human cell culture and animal model studies, we now intend to determine efficacy and safety of this approach to induce dystrophin exon skipping in children with DMD.

The specific aim of this phase I/II study is to assess efficacy (dystrophin production) and safety of intramuscular administered morpholino oligomer directed against exon 51 (AVI-4658 PMO).

We aim to determine the effect of CRT-D or CRT-P implantation in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients.

The reason why we initiated this trial is the lack of evidence-based treatment for the significant number of these patients. In these patients, 5-year mortality remains as high as 20% despite recent therapeutic advances. Based on currently available evidence, because of a significant decrease in mortality due to modern pharmacotherapy, it is not certain which of these patients should receive a CRT-P and who should receive a CRT-D. No dedicated and adequately powered trial has addressed this important question.

We hypothesize that patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤35%, without left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis on LGE-CMR, will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation.

If our hypothesis is confirmed, this could provide evidence for the management of these patients with a significant impact on common daily praxis and health care expenditures.

We aim to enroll 600 patients in the trial. 924 patients are needed to be screened for these 600 patients to be randomized.

Patients with non-ischemic HF visiting an out-patient department and possibly eligible for the trial will have their pharmacotherapy optimized.

Patients with a significant amount of fibrosis will be excluded from the study and treated according to local practice with an emphasis on ICD implantation to prevent SCD.

After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, subjects will be randomized by the physicians who enrolled them in a 1:1 ratio to receive CRT-D or CRT-P implantation.

Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. There was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. But now, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.

Aim

1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.
2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).
3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).

Methods

This study contains three parts:

Part 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.

In Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see ""3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).

In Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.

NCT05601986,Motor Imagery on Children With DMD on Gait and Balance Functions,,RECRUITING,"The most common muscular dystrophy among pediatric neuromuscular diseases is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). There is no consensus on a standardized physiotherapy and rehabilitation program or exercise prescription in DMD. Motor imagery (MI) is defined as visualizing motor activities in one's mind without performing any movement. There are studies examining the effectiveness of motor imagery in stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's, peripheral facial paralysis, and phantom pain. This study is aimed to examine the effect of motor imagery on gait and balance functions in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Boys residing in Istanbul Turkey, between the ages of 5 and 12, with a diagnosis of DMD who have not lost their ability to ambulate independently will be included in the study. The included individuals will be divided into two groups due to randomization: Group A (Control Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program) and Group B (Additional Motor Imagery Training to Intervention Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program). While the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program is applied to the participants in Group A with 40-minute sessions on 2 non-consecutive days of the week for 8 weeks, the participants in Group B will receive an additional 25-30-minute motor imagery program to the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program. Participants were tested with Kinovea Gait Analysis, Timed Up and Go Test, 2 Minute Walking Test, Motor Function Rating Scale for Neuromuscular Diseases, timed performance tests, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Pediatric Fear of Fall Questionnaire (Ped-FOF) before and after the program. will be evaluated later.

- Children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) slowly lose muscle function. They usually die at a young age. Some mothers adapt to the demands of caring for a child with this disease better than others. Studies show that a person s hope may positively affect how they cope and adapt. Researchers want to find out more about this. They want to develop ways to improve caregivers overall wellness.

Objective:

- To study the relationships between uncertainty, hope, and coping ability in mothers of children with DBMD.

Eligibility:

- Women in the United States 18 years and older. They must be biological mothers of a living child with DBMD and be able to answer a survey in English.

Design:

* This study is part of a larger study that examines the well-being of mothers with sons who have DBMD.
* Participants will take a questionnaire. The questionnaire can be done on paper or on a computer. It will take 30 45 minutes to complete.

NCT02036463,A Trial of Chronotherapy of Corticosteroids in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,WITHDRAWN,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease for which no curative treatment has yet been identified, making it important to slow progression and improve the quality of life among affected boys and young men. Treatment with corticosteroids is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to the robust observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of ambulation but is associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted in the youngest age group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes are measurable, ages 3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of corticosteroid administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability and at least comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always given in the morning. Furthermore, the trial provides a unique opportunity to rigorously evaluate corticosteroid effects in the young DMD patient, both for efficacy as compared to placebo and as a study of the impact of corticosteroid chronotherapy, or delayed release, on increased tolerability over standard therapy. The main hypothesis is that synchronization of the timing of corticosteroid dosing will improve medication tolerability in children, while maintaining (non-inferiority) the efficacy of corticosteroid.

NCT06337669,Characterization of DupEx2 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,DMDDup2,RECRUITING,"To characterize the clinical phenotype and possible predictive/prognostic factors of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to duplication of exon 2 (Dup2). Specifically, we aim 1) to describe the progression of motor, respiratory and cardiac function; 2) to enquire if the phenotypic spectrum of Dup2 is milder than classic DMD, 3) to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize DNA breakpoints to correlate with the phenotype; 4) to collect material for future proteomic/transcriptomic studies.

Background/Rationale DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene and in 11% of cases is due to duplications. The most promising therapeutic approaches include mutation-specific therapies. Notably, there is increasing evidence that specific groups of mutations may underlie different disease trajectories compared to the ""average"" DMD population. It is thus mandatory to have more information on genotype-phenotype correlations and patterns of progression related to different genotypes.

Dup2 is the most common DMD duplication and the only one for which a AAV-mediated exon skipping study is ongoing. Despite most case series and databases ascribe Dup2 to severe phenotype, our preliminary findings sustain that these patients have collectively a milder progression of the disease and in 1/3 of cases a significantly milder phenotype. Moreover, our attempts to reveal mechanism involved in attenuating the phenotype would confute the hypothesis of alternative spicing transcripts as previously described for DMD with deletion of exon 2.

Research design and methods Clinical information regarding a cohort of 26 Italian Dup2 patients will be collected. Differences in time to loss of ambulation compared to a DMD control group will be achieved. Finally, we will retrieve DNA for correlative WGS studies.

NCT06124196,Wearable Technology to Evaluate Hyperglycemia and HRV in DMD,,RECRUITING,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that causes muscle wasting, cardiopulmonary failure, and premature death. Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD-CM, now the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids (GCs), sarcopenia, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.

The goal of this remote study is to evaluate rates of hyperglycemia in individuals with DMD compared to control participants using continuous glucose monitors, and to determine the relationship between hyperglycemia and heart rate variability.

This can be performed from 9 weeks of amenorrhea and offers an early, safe and accurate definitive diagnosis without the miscarriage risk associated with invasive procedures. One of the major difficulties is distinguishing fetal genotype in the high background of maternal cfDNA, which leads to several technical and analytical challenges. Besides, unlike noninvasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy, NIPD for monogenic diseases represent a smaller market opportunity, and many cases must be provided on a bespoke, patient- or disease-specific basis.

NCT05559710,Motor Imagery in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Motor imagery (MI) can be defined as a dynamic process in which the person is mentally stimulated without performing the given motor movement. Studies of imagery; demonstrated that it alters a person's ability to learn, performance skills, and important cognitive skills (self-efficacy, self-confidence, effort, motivation). In recent years, it has been shown that motor imagery techniques are used for therapeutic purposes as a current neurorehabilitation approach and that imagery can have positive effects on improving motor activity and functions. However, it has been reported that the biggest difficulty in the use of imagery techniques is the inability to determine to what extent the individual can perform mental representation of movements. For this reason, it is thought that it is necessary to evaluate the motor imagery ability first in order to identify the patients who are suitable for motor imagery training. The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ) is a motor imagery questionnaire developed for individuals with limited mobility for different reasons. The questionnaire assesses both the visual and kinesthetic dimensions of motor imagery. of the KVIQ; It has also been shown in the literature that it is a valid and reliable questionnaire that enables the appropriate evaluation of motor imagery in different neurological disease groups such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. However, the literature When examined, no evidence was found about the motor imagery ability of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is foreseen that KVIQ will be especially suitable for patients with DMD of different functional levels, since all its items have been developed to be applied to people with limited physical mobility or physically disabled people in a sitting position.

NCT01451281,"Studying Skeletal Muscle, Heart, and Diaphragm Imaging in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease in which the muscles are unable to make the protein dystrophin. Without this protein, the muscles become gradually weaker. A new medicine called GSK2402968 is being tested to see if it can help prevent or slow down this loss of muscle strength. In this study, boys with DMD and healthy volunteers will have different types of imaging studies to see which ones provide the best images of the muscles. This information will help researchers use these imaging techniques to test the safety and effectiveness of GSK2402968 and other agents.

Objectives:

- To test magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound techniques that can detect changes in muscles of boys with DMD.

Eligibility:

* Boys who have DMD and are in the GSK2402968 drug test study.
* Healthy boys of the same age as the above study participants.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.
* Healthy volunteers will have one 2-hour visit with three tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the skeletal muscles and heart and diaphragm muscles will be carried out. Muscle ultrasound imaging of leg and arm muscles will also be done. Participants should not perform heavy physical activity like school sports or long walks during the week before the visit.
* Participants in the GSK2402968 study will have the same series of tests as the healthy volunteers. The tests will be given during the study screening phase.

NCT02421523,Strength Training in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that causes muscle breakdown, weakness, and eventual death. Over the last 40 years parents have received little guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function. It is well known that high intensity exercise and eccentric contractions can result in muscle damage in dystrophic muscle, yet the absence of muscle loading will conversely result in muscle wasting. Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider its implementation in boys with DMD.

The goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been adequately explored using human subjects.

NCT02835079,Treatment Effect of Tamoxifen on Patients With DMD,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births. The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.

In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.

Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:

(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.

In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action.

NCT02436720,Upper Limb Assessment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,PUL in DMD,UNKNOWN,"The literature on outcome measures assessing upper limbs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is quite scanty. While there have been considerable advances for ambulant DMD boys, no prospective study has so far been devoted to outcome measures in non ambulant patients, with increasing complaints from families and patients. This information appears to be highly important not only for a better understanding of the progression of the disease but also for possible enrollment of patients in future trials.

The aim of this project is to identify outcome measures for non ambulant patients in an Italian population of DMD patients. At least 200 non ambulant DMD boys and adults will be included in the study. All patients will be assessed using the newly developed Performance of Upper limb (PUL) test. This measure will be used at baseline and 6 and 12 months after baseline. This will allow to monitor possible changes over time and the rate of changes in patients with different level of ability and age. As part of this study the investigators will also correlate possible changes in upper limb function with other measures of care and function such as the EK scale.

The investigators aim to assess the suitability of the individual measures in a large number of patients, trying to establish whether whole scales or individual items appear to be relevant across ages and level of abilities. The investigators also aim to assess the suitability of the selected measures in a multicentric setting and the quantity of training required The data collected will also be analysed using Rasch analysis in order to improve the statistical properties of the measures used.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,,assessment of upper limb (PUL),,Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bambino Gesù Hospital, IRCCS National Neurological Institute ""C.

NCT01521546,Eplerenone for Subclinical Cardiomyopathy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,E-SCAR DMD,COMPLETED,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common muscular dystrophy, leads to skeletal and cardiac muscle damage. Treatment of pulmonary complications has improved survival; however, heart muscle disease or cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death, typically by the third decade. Although myocardial changes begin early, clinically significant heart disease is rarely detected in the first decade of life. Consequently, DMD cardiomyopathy frequently goes unrecognized (and untreated) until advanced (and irreversible).

Current DMD cardiovascular care guidelines recommend beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) when decreased ejection fraction (EF) is noted by echocardiography (echo); however, this strategy has not significantly improved outcomes. Our team has recently made a breakthrough in a mouse study, showing in a model that causes the same heart muscle disease in humans with DMD adding an old medicine traditionally used for high blood pressure and late-stage heart failure can actually prevent heart muscle damage. Because of this drug's proven safety in both children and adults, it is ready to be studied immediately in an RCT in patients with DMD to hopefully show, as we did in mice, that we can prevent the devastating consequences of heart muscle damage.",True,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,"DRUG, DRUG","eplerenone, placebo",12-month Change in Myocardial Strain,,Subha Raman,Ballou Skies,MALE,7 Years,,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,42,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,TREATMENT,2011H0251,,2012-02,2016-06,2016-06,2012-01-30,2015-05-27,2016-11-08,2024-12-10T07:22:19.264591

NCT06103006,Remote Physiotherapy to Protect Physical Health in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive loss of motor function, respiratory failure, and cardiomyopathy required regular physiotherapy. With the outbreak of the pandemic rehabilitation centers that make up the weekly physiotherapy routine of children with disabilities have slowed down or even stopped their activities. So DMD who have additional diseases such as respiratory muscle weakness, spinal deformity, obesity, and cardiac dysfunction have also been negatively affected. The 'telerehabilitation' method, which is well planned and prepared for the abilities and needs of patients and caregivers, is seen as a good option at this point.

Studies, reporting the feasibility and safety of telerehabilitation in joint replacement, multiple sclerosis, and post-operative conditions, report that the length of stay was reduced, there was access to the same level of service regardless of the distance, and there was no travel cost. Despite these advantages, the framework and applicability of telerehabilitation programs have been investigated limited and not focused on effectiveness of telerehabilitation in patients with DMD.

According to the current knowledge, telerehabilitation in DMD is a subject that needs to be investigated in terms of its benefits.

NCT01519349,Follistatin Gene Transfer to Patients With Becker Muscular Dystrophy and Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis,,COMPLETED,"The investigators are performing a gene therapy clinical trial in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) patients. Both of these conditions have an important common feature: loss of ability to walk because of weakness of the thigh muscles. The investigators plan to do a gene therapy trial to deliver a gene to muscle called follistatin (FS344) that can build muscle size and strength. If successful, the investigators can increase the size of the thigh muscle and potentially prolong a patient's ability to walk. The gene will be carried into the muscle by a virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV). This virus occurs naturally in muscle and does not cause any human disease, setting the stage for its safe use in a clinical trial.

Presently there is no treatment that can reverse Becker muscular dystrophy or sporadic inclusion body myositis. Only supportive care is currently possible.

In this study, subjects with either of these diseases will have shots of the follistatin gene injected directly into thigh muscle on one (first cohort) or both legs (2nd and 3rd cohort). One hundred and eighty days following the gene delivery, the muscle will undergo biopsy to look closely at the muscle to see if the muscle fibers are bigger. Between the time of the gene transfer and the muscle biopsy, patients will be carefully monitored for any side effects of the treatment. This will include an MRI of the thigh muscle before treatment and at day 180 following treatment. Blood and urine tests, as well as physical examination will be done on the subjects during the screening visit and on days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 to make sure that there are no side effects from the gene injections. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks post-biopsy.

NCT02037243,Disgust and Shame Based Safe Water and Handwashing Promotion,,COMPLETED,"An estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5 years die from diarrheal disease each year. Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to warrant being rolled out at scale.

Research into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be rigorously tested.

The investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.

1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment
2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand Washing
3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment
4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand

This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.

Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.

At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.

In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products.

In people with DBMD, dystrophin is not present or lacking in heart and muscle. This is associated with abnormalities in an enzyme called ""neuronal nitric oxide synthase"" or nNOS, and leads to decreases in ""cyclic GMP,"" which is necessary for proper function of those muscles. Revatio blocks an enzyme called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), and helps to restore the normal amounts of cyclic GMP. The purpose of this research is to determine if Revatio is safe for people with DBMD and if it can improve heart function.

NCT06093100,Wearable Technology to Evaluate Hyperglycemia and HRV in DMD - Longitudinal Aim,,RECRUITING,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that causes muscle wasting, cardiopulmonary failure, and premature death. Heart failure is a leading cause of death in DMD, but substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding predisposing risk factors. In the general population, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and decreased heart rate variability (HRV; reflecting autonomic dysfunction) are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). It is unclear whether these factors are associated with DMD-CM. Closing this knowledge gap may lead to novel screening and therapeutic strategies to delay progression of DMD related CM. Despite risk factors for hyperglycemia, including the use of glucocorticoids, low muscle mass, obesity, and reduced ambulation, little is known regarding glucose abnormalities in DMD. Some of these same risk factors, along with the distance needed to travel for specialty care, present significant barriers to research participation and clinical care for individuals with DMD. Remote wearable technology may improve research participation in this vulnerable population. Therefore, this study will leverage remote wearable technologies to overcome these barriers and define the relationship between dysglycemia and DMD-CM.

In this Aim of the study, the investigators will assess the utility of remote wearable technology to predict changes in traditional metrics of metabolism and cardiac function. In this pilot study, 10 individuals with DMD will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at baseline and two years.

It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease.

NCT01386515,The Role of Family Functioning in Promoting Adaptation in Siblings of Individuals With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),,TERMINATED,"Background:

We want to learn more about the relationship between the way families function and how children adapt to having a sibling with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). What we learn will help us design better interventions for families.

Objective:

* To learn more about how families with an individual with DMD function.
* To learn how siblings adapt in families with an individual with DMD.

Eligibility:

* One parent and one child, age 13-18, from a family where another child has DMD.
* The parent and the child must be able to read and write English.

Design:

* One parent from each family will complete a survey about how family members communicate and relate with each other. The parent will also answer questions about the behavior of the child without DMD. This survey will take you about 40 minutes to complete.
* One child from each family, either a boy or a girl, will also complete a survey. This survey asks about how he/she views him/herself. It also asks about how he/she interacts with peers and family members and how he/she behaves. The survey also asks how satisfied he/she is with how his/her family functions.

NCT06574919,Clinical and Functional Assessment of Patients With Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies in Sohag University Hospital,,RECRUITING,"Muscular Myopathies are a heterogenous group of inherited muscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Historically, these disorders are difficult to treat. In the last three decades, there is a great progress in molecular and genetic basis of these disorders; early diagnosis is achievable with proper clinical recognition and advanced genetic testing \[1\].

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular muscular X-linked recessive disorders that belong to a group of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that placed in the middle of short arm of X chromosome \[2\]. Mutation in this gene lead to absence of dystrophin or structural defects of this protein. The lack of functional dystrophin impairs the structure and function of myofibers which are essential for physiological growth of muscle tissue \[3\].

The non-dystrophic myopathies are a group of inherited myopathies defined by distinctive static histochemical and/or characteristic ultrastructural changes on muscle.

The nomenclature of dystrophic myopathies can be confusing as some of them are classified by age of onset of symptoms (e.g., congenital muscular dystrophies), whereas others are classified by distribution of weakness (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, distal myopathies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), by characteristic clinical features (e.g., myotonic dystrophy), by the name of the causative gene (e.g., GNE-myopathy, dystrophinopathies), whereas others are named after the physician first describing the disease (i.e., Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy or Bethlem myopathy) or can be subdivided in an entirely different way (i.e., the subgroups of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies which were named according to their mode of inheritance and order of publication) \]4\[ Several aspects need to be taken into account in order to establish a clinical diagnosis; these features include but are not limited to the severity of the muscular wasting, as well as its distribution, and the accompanying symptomology, biochemical, hematological, physical, and neurological investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Moreover, if the gene defect is established, diagnosis can also be confirmed by gene testing \]5\[

Muscle biopsy lacks of typical dystrophic features such as increased conjunctive endomysial tissue, necrosis, and regeneration and shows one or more characteristic histological features. Based in pathological descriptions, the main non-dystrophic myopathies were described during the last century, taking into account the age of onset and the structural or ultrastructural markers \[6\].

Certain genes, in particular those with large sizes (TTN, RYR1, NEB), may present with different clinical and histological phenotypes and therefore their related myopathies be classified within different groups \[7\].

It is useful to know that other genetic myopathies may mimic non-dystrophic myopathies. This is the case of certain metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies that may show very selective muscle weakness. The description of these disorders goes beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it may be useful to take into account at least three examples, Pompe disease, the glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), and TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, because they may present as congenital or later-onset non-dystrophic myopathies, may show particular muscle imaging abnormalities, and may be treatable \[8; 9\].

Understanding the clinical and molecular characteristics of non-DMD is crucial for several reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling and family planning. Second, identification of the specific genetic mutation allows for the potential development of targeted therapies in the future. Finally, characterization of the clinical course of different non-DMD can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.",False,Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies,,,Clinical and Functional Assessment of patients with Inherited Non-Duchenne Myopathies in Sohag University Hospital,,Sohag University,,ALL,2 Years,18 Years,"CHILD, ADULT",,30,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,,Soh-Med-24-07-15MS,,2024-08-01,2025-08-01,2025-08-01,2024-08-28,,2024-08-28,2024-12-10T07:22:19.264591

The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of a disease-specific, individualized diet on the nutritional status and functional abilities of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. The study will focus on children aged 4-8 years residing in Ankara, Turkey.

Key questions the investigators aim to answer:

Can a tailored dietary intervention improve the nutritional status of DMD patients? Does a specialized diet positively impact the functional abilities of DMD patients, as measured by the North Star Ambulation Assessment (NSAA)? Participants will undergo a comprehensive nutritional assessment, including anthropometric measurements, and will receive individualized dietary counseling.

NCT01981915,Optimum Insufflation Capacity in NMD,,COMPLETED,"Patients with underlying neuromuscular disorder (NMD) often suffer from weakness in the inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital. Therefore, secretion and cough management is a mandatory part of the therapeutic concept for treating patients with neuromuscular disease.

The therapeutic efficacy of the Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver(LIA) integrated in the ventilator VENTIlogic LS-plus manufactured by Weinmann GmbH+Co KG was studied in a pilot study carried out by the Dep. for Pediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at the University Hospital of Essen/Germany in cooperation with Research \& Development at Weinmann GmbH \&Co KG, Germany . The objective of the pilot study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of LIAM as a cough support function in patients with neuromuscular disease and indications for mechanical ventilation.

We hypothesized that i) a certain insufflation maneuver pressure may be optimal to achieve the highest individual peak cough flow and ii) that this pressure is below the pressure needed to achieve the maximum insufflation capacity. We define the lowest insufflation capacity at which the best individual PCF can be achieved as optimum insufflation capacity (OIC). The study was performed using two different techniques in order to demonstrate that findings are not dependent on maneuver details but are rather based on effects of maneuver pressure. The protocol was limited to techniques which do not require breath stacking: i) insufflation with an Intermittend Positive Pressure (IPPB) device and ii) with the VENTIlogic LS using LIAM.",False,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency","PROCEDURE, PROCEDURE","IPPB, LIAM",insufflation capacity,Peak cough flow,Universität Duisburg-Essen,Weinmann Geräte für Medizin GmbH + Co.

NCT01070511,Tadalafil in Becker Muscular Dystrophy,,COMPLETED,"Summary for Patients: This study, funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is intended to build on recent findings published in the journal Nature showing beneficial effects of tadalafil (also known as Cialis) in mice with an animal version of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Only two doses of tadalafil improved muscle blood flow, allowing the dystrophic mice to perform more exercise with less muscle injury. This new short-term clinical trial will move the testing from animals to human patients with Becker muscular dystrophy and examine the effects of acute tadalafil dosing on muscle blood flow during a bout of exercise. Patients will take two doses of tadalafil prior to exercising. Then doctors will measure whether muscles receive increased blood flow and therefore are better protected during exercise.

Scientific Hypothesis: In patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (particularly those with dystrophin gene mutations between exons 41-46), loss of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase engenders functional muscle ischemia and thus muscle edema after an acute bout of exercise. The investigators further hypothesize that PDE5A inhibition, which boosts nitric oxide-cGMP signaling, constitutes an effective new countermeasure for these patients.",False,Becker Muscular Dystrophy,"DRUG, DRUG","Tadalafil, Placebo","Reflex decrease in muscle tissue oxygenation (i.e., adrenergic vasoconstriction) during rhythmic handgrip exercise measured by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR).",Change in forearm muscle water content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,Muscular Dystrophy Association,MALE,18 Years,55 Years,ADULT,PHASE4,48,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,BASIC_SCIENCE,MDA 158944,,2010-01,2012-12,2012-12,2010-02-18,,2013-08-20,2024-12-10T07:22:19.264591
NCT06412328,Psychoeducation Program for Parents of Children With DMD,,COMPLETED,"Having and caring for a child with disabilities brings emotional, social and economic difficulties for many families. Families may experience many physiological and psychological problems due to the stress and anxiety they experience. In addition, it is seen that families with children with disabilities give up their existing roles, reduce their participation in social activities, and reach stagnation in their social lives. Mothers are affected psychologically more than fathers and feel lonely. It is stated that mothers believe that they cannot afford everything in the face of the responsibilities they carry and accordingly, they experience emotional and psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness and tantrums.

Living with a child with a disability causes family members to experience different emotions as mentioned above; families may frequently experience fear, anxiety, guilt, anger and depression. It is reported that mothers of children with DMD experience depression, anxiety about the future and uncertainty more than mothers of healthy children. Families of children with DMD reported that they felt tired and fatigued during the process of caring for the child and had difficulties in participating in social activities and allocating time for themselves. Most of these families stated that they needed psychological and social support. Therefore, it is important to address the psychiatric aspects of families with children with DMD during the disease process. Parental health contributes positively to the health and adaptation of the family in general. Examining the psychiatric symptoms caused by the problems experienced by families related to DMD and how they cope with this stress will be useful in evaluating and addressing these families. In addition, the social support that families with children with disabilities receive from their immediate environment and institutions is also an important issue. It has been reported that social support from relatives, friends, neighbors, organizations and communities increases the psychological resilience levels of families, they feel that they are not alone in the face of problems, and their anxiety levels decrease. In the literature, it is generally mentioned that when the culture of pediatric care is supportive and family-oriented, the care of the patient will undergo a change when transitioning from pediatric care to the adult period. However, studies evaluating the problems experienced by families in the care of patients with DMD, psychiatric symptoms, ways of coping with stress and perceived social support are insufficient. It is important to evaluate the problems experienced by parents in the families of children with DMD in developing skills to cope with the disease process and disease-related problems, and then to provide training in these areas. Because if parents, who are in the role of caregivers, are equipped with knowledge and skills in this context, they will provide better care and be more useful to their children with DMD.

The study is based on the recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Adamo et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with Becker dystrophy.

In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction.

Gene therapy by exon skipping or stop codon read-through and cell therapy are at the stage of clinical assays with very promising results. Nevertheless, they will not allow a complete cure of DMD patients and they will concern only specific types of mutations. It is therefore crucial to develop other therapeutic strategies related to the natural history of the disease and targeted not on the dystrophin itself, but on the consequences of its absence.

Another crucial pathophysiological pathway in DMD is muscle cell calcium homeostasis, particularly via the ryanodine recepteur (RyR1).

Our study focus on the relationship between endomysial fibrosis, abnormal inflammation response and calcium homeostasis dysfunction which are not entirely established in DMD.
